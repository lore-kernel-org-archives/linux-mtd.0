Yes it is trying to handle the comment above. Well, the other two
platforms I am aware of are also different architectures... (PowerPC and
ColdFire). I think we won't have a multi-architecture kernel anytime
soon, hence I think removing the code at compile time is the right thing
todo.

However, probably CONFIG_SOC_VF610 is the wrong symbol then, I could
just use CONFIG_ARM and add a comment that this might be different on
another other ARM SoC than VF610.

Just checked CodingStyle, and I see that IS_ENABLED is the preferred way
for conditional compiling.

So my suggestion:

static void vf610_nfc_select_chip(struct mtd_info *mtd, int chip)
{
	struct vf610_nfc *nfc = mtd_to_nfc(mtd);
	u32 tmp = vf610_nfc_read(nfc, NFC_ROW_ADDR);

	if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ARM))
		return;

	/*
	 * This code is only tested on the ARM platform VF610
	 * PowerPC based MPC5125 would have full RB and four CS
	 */
....

With that the compiler should be able to remove this (currently) ARM
VF610 specific code on the other supported architectures...

What do you think?

It seems that MCP5125 is different than VF610. MCP5125 has 4 chip
selects and 4 R/B signals, whereas VF610 has only 2 chip selects and
just 1 R/B signals...

Ok, will add that information under limitations.
