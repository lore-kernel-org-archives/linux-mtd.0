In September I've sent a series of patches to enhance the support of QSPI flash
memories. Patch 4 was dedicated to the m25p80 driver and set the
rx_nbits / tx_nbits fields of spi_transfer struct(s) in order to configure the
number of I/O lines independently for the opcode, address and data parts.
The work was done for m25p80_read() but also for _read_reg(), _write_reg() and
_write().
The patched m25p80 driver was then tested with an at25 memory to check non-
regression.

This series of patches also added 4 enum spi_protocol fields inside struct
spi_nor so the spi-nor framework can tell the (Q)SPI controller driver what SPI
protocol should be use for erase, read, write and register read/write
operations, depending on the memory manufacturer and the command opcode.
This was done to better support Micron, Spansion and Macronix QSPI memories.

I have tested the series with Micron QSPI memories and Atmel QSPI controller
and I guess Marek also tested it on his side with Spansion QSPI memories and
another QSPI controller.

So if it can help other developers to develop QSPI controller drivers, the
series is still available there:

for the whole series:
