Hi Nicholas,

Sorry, I could not understand why you thought sdhci-cadence.c seemed a bug.

The SDHCI_CDNS_HRS06_TUNE_UP is auto-cleared by the hardware.
This will normally be done really soon (within 1us),
but it may not be cleared if the hardware is in trouble.
It is the intention of the code:

    readl_poll_timeout(reg, tmp, !(tmp & SDHCI_CDNS_HRS06_TUNE_UP),
                       0, 1);

I notice you were sending this to me, but
please notice I am not responsible for this file
(include/linux/iopoll.h) in any way.

Please take my comments for grain of salt:

With this patch, the sleep range is doubled in each iteration.
Let's say this routine is called with delay_us=1, timeout_us=50,
then it slept 16 us, then 32 us.
If it sleeps 64 us in the next iteration,
it ends up with sleeping 112 us (=16 + 32 + 64) in total
where we know waiting 50 us is enough.
So, the sleep range granularity may get bigger than
users' intention.

Probably, waiting too long is not a problem in most cases.
If so, what is the meaning of the argument "sleep_us" after all?
