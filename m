What are partitions then?

What exactly the kernel supports ATM is irrelevant. I'm fully aware
that the kernel's NAND support has huge gaps in its ability to support
raw NAND at typical SSD speeds. My last employer had delusions about
doing that. Fortunately, NAND manufacturers don't really want to sell
you raw NAND anyway.

My point here was only that the partitions node may not be under the
CS nodes, but at the same level. Or maybe partitions in DT just
doesn't make sense at all for interleaved cases.
