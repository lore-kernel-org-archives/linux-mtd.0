I think it's the chip-enable use case, isn't it?

Then they can't share the CS line (or be actived at the same time), at
least it doesn't make any sense to me.

You seem to argue on all the minor things I'm asking. Honestly, it
should be hard or error-prone to do it. And let's say you don't support
it in your driver, you should still think about that when designing
your bindings.

Hm, you should at least take the capabilities you know about into
account when defining a new binding, and you already know that some
SoCs might decide to expose 2 or more R/B pins, so it should already be
designed this way.

Actually this has been added to the nand_flash_dev structure, and it's
called onfi_timing_mode_default [1].
If you need a different timing, define a full ID entry for your NAND.

Note that I'm also reworking the NAND detection code to let vendor
specific code initialize a few things [2], which should allow us to get
rid of the full-id entries. This timing mode tweaking could/should be
done at this level.

I'm opposed to the idea of putting information that can be
automatically deduced in the DT. For this specific case, the main
reason is that a board vendor can decide to use different NAND chips
on the same design, and they might not all share the same
capabilities (and you don't want to have a dts for each NAND).
