UBIFS is a filesystem designed for MTD devices.
It works on top of UBI which is kind of a LVM for NAND and NOR flashes.
On Linux MTD devices are represented as character devices, this is why
the UBI device nodes are of type character.
For more details please see:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubifs.html

Of course UBIFS will not work on top of loop or dm-flakey.
AFAIK the generic tests don't use them anyway.

I'd like to have UBIFS tested with xfstests because xfstests has a very
good set of generic fs tests.
Currently UBIFS fails 20 out of 76 generic tests.
At least one issue is real. As soon I have the time I'll
inspect all other failures in detail.

I fear blkid does not detect UBIFS, but we can match it from the device node name.
UBIFS can only work on top of an UBI volume. UBI volumes have names like /dev/ubiX_Y.
Where X is the UBI image number and Y the volume number.

See above. I match the string "ubi" in /dev/ubiX_Y.

Will fix!
