First off, I should clarify this: the above comment was speaking *only* 
about surrounding the #include's with #ifdef's. Such #ifdef's only make 
everything else harder.

Now, I recognize that there are still many cases where you may need 
#ifdef's in the body of the code. I was only trying to hit the easiest ones.

The __maybe_unused attribute can be given to functions that will compile 
but are unused, and the compiler will just remove unused ones from the 
binary without warning. That is probably (weakly) preferable to 
#ifdef's, if you can manage it. But I understand some #ifdef's are 
necessary.

nand_bch.c (and its corresponding nand_bch.h) has stub implementations 
so that extra #ifdef's often aren't needed. But include/linux/bch.h does 
not, so you are correct.

Great, thanks for the effort.
