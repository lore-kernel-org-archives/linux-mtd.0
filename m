I would say "strongy rejecting", more advising a different approach
to solve the problem.  i.e. with a "return 0" ->direct_IO method,
applications that use direct IO won't randomly fail or refuse to
run.  That seems like a much better (and simpler!) solution compared
to chasing down applications that use direct IO and changing
them....

Cheers,

Dave.
