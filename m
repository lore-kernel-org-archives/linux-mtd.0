For the sake of argument: within a cyclic event (wave theory) you are 
quite right with
this definition: the period describes the time to complete one cycle (or 
oscillation).
However, in English[1] a period is simply a length of time, carrying no 
further
specification about any recurrence of events.
Having said that, you're the person who still has to look at this code 
three weeks from
now. I personally find "timing" a confusing name because it is more 
abstract than
what the value holds (the interval/period/duration of a memory "state"), 
but if you find
that clearer, it's your final call!

clk_cycles it is.

Works for me.

I hope to send you a V3 today once we get that bike shed painted :-). Yours,
