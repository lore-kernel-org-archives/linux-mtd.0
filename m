OK. We don't have it, so I'll add that patch for review too (I have submitted
one for sandisk, should have been m-systems ...)

Ah you know what, you made me understand something in here.
As there is no spec of this device, I had created the driver by observing its
behaviour under another OS on a single chip, a 512 Mbits (ie. 64MBi) one.

I had assumed that the identification string, "0x200" (ie. DOC_CHIPID_G3) was
the identifier of a G3 chip. But you opened my eyes in here : it's the size of
the docg3 !

So your answer is :
 - a docg3 cannot be identified (from another diskonchip)
 - the variant of the docg3, ie. its size, can be identified (even if that
 doesn't change anything from a device-tree perspective). It's just something
 the driver should take into account.
 - I'm not aware of any other kind of variations nor any way to query them

Ah, no spec, no answer I'm afraid.
There might be variations in the ECC algorith, block size, etc ... but still no
spec.

I'm pretty sure the device has an interrupt line, and a requestor line for a DMA
most probably. No clue but heavy presomptions.

Ah ok, I'll put that in v2.

Cheers.
