There's no need to change the code to update the documentation. Simply 
paste the list of valid device IDs into the documentation. The binding 
documentation needs to be completely standalone anyway. Binding 
documentation should never refer to Linux driver code as part of their 
definition.

You can never remove the currently-supported device-specific IDs from 
the driver, since existing DTs need to continue working forever, even 
with future drivers/kernels.

The binding document should also always include a complete list of 
supported flash devices. Standard practice is that the DT compatible 
property contains a list of compatible values, starting with the 
device-specific value, and followed by any generic values. All of those 
values should be standardized and specified in the DT documentation, 
even if the DT binding is written in such a way that a compliant driver 
need only actively match on the generic value. The device-specific 
values may not be used today, but are present in case some 
device-specific workaround needs to be retro-actively 
implemented/enabled, since that needs to happen for existing DTs too.

I am not a DT maintainer, but the DT documentation part of this change:
