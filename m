Right, looking through our downstream support, we may need to upstream a
few changes to make upstream driver work on SoCFPGA.

I would like to propose "altr,denali-nand" as the binding we use to support the
driver going forward on SoCFPGA hardware. It's pretty much the same as
"altera,denali-nand", just with the correct vendor prefix.

If we can please keep, "denali,denali-nand-dt" only because SoCFPGA is using
this binding downstream, but I know that is a weak argument.
