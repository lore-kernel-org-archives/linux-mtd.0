Hi, Brain

I resend with non-html format to make it acceptable in mail list.

Yes, exactly.
And the NAND probe will also load the NFC device before it reach above 
check code.
That is what I want: make *nfc probe function* is running before reach 
above check code.

So I don't think there is a race, as NFC probe will always run before 
the check code:
   if (nand_nfc.is_initialized) {
     ...

I think my subsequent patch is to move the register/unregister() 
function to the module_init/exit().
And in the module_init(), make sure register NFC driver before NAND driver.
That means I will revert the change that convert module_init/exit() to 
module_platform_driver_probe().

So the whole flow will like that:

module_init()
   register nfc driver
   register nand driver

nand driver probe() {
     # register nfc driver --> move to module_init()
     populate nfc device
       since nfc driver is registered, so nfc_probe() is called (init nfc)
     check whether nfc is initialized
     ...
   }

module_exit()
   unregister nand driver
   unregister nfc driver
