So are you saying that the driver currently doesn't work if you started
in x16 buswidth? Are you having problems with a particular setup? What
sort of devices are you testing?

Running nand_scan_ident() with x8 when the device is actualy x16 will
just cause nand_scan_ident() to abort with an error. It doesn't help you
with the fact that RESET/READID/PARAM need special 8-bit handling on x16
devices, so you're not solving the problem alluded to by Matthieu.

What is your patch trying to solve? It seems like it's just a distortion
of the same code that existed previously. It tries running
nand_scan_ident() in one buswidth configuration, and then it tries the
other if it failed. You still aren't doing either of the options we
talked about previously. I'll repeat them:

(1) You specify the buswidth given by device-tree/platform-data; if this
    is incorrect, you fail

(2) You auto-configure using NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO, and you use that to
    validate the platform data; you just warn if the buswidth provided
    by device-tree/platform-data was incorrect

Am I sensing that you are having some implementation problem with one of
these? You really shouldn't need to run nand_scan_ident() twice.

Or perhaps the "solution" in this patch is just that you're moving
around the reassignment of the callback functions? If so, this is not
obvious... see below.

Why is this comment separated from the comment below it? Either give a
newline between them (if they're really separate) or make it a single
comment block.

You only print this message in one case (detect x8, but DT said x16) and
not the other (detect x16, but DT said x8). This is a result of your
unnecessarily complicated logic here.

So am I to understand that the main purpose of this patch is not about
the detection of the buswidth type, but about the (re)assignment of the
callback functions? If so, you aren't making it very clear. (I wasn't
paying too much attention to the fact that this code block is being
moved across all the callback assignments.) The above code is just a
more verbose way of doing the same thing as the code you're replacing,
with an extra check to compare with the device-tree/platform-data.

Anyway, I'm just going to have to flat out NAK this patch for now.
Please rework the series without this patch and we can continue
discussion of this patch independently (for one, this thread does not
need to CC all of the device-tree folks).
