It's definitely not describing the hardware, and I never said
describing partitions in the DT was following the number one rule:
"only describe your HW" ;-).
I'm generally not in favor of this kind of restrictions, I'm just
pointing the irony of the situation here :p.

IMHO, if we had to support this aggregation feature, the NAND cluster
should be represented using a different node, outside of the nand
controller node.
Theoretically, you can perfectly have several NAND chips connected to
different NAND controllers, but still want to aggregate those chips
into a single entity.

Anyway, that's not the topic here, and since other bindings are already
describing partitions under the nand device node and not the nand
controller node, I think we can keep doing like this until we find a
better solution.

Boris
