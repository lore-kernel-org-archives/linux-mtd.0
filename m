Flash data sheets use the terms Dual and Quad I/O Mode,
e.g. for MX25L25635E

"bitwidth" != "bandwidth", but maybe the name could be improved,
how about xfer_width?  The mmc susbsysem has something similar
and calls it bus_width.

I'm not aware that bidirectional transfers are supported in
dual or quad IO mode.  I think only flash supports it and
uses all available IO lines as either input (flash write
command) or output (flash read command).  I.e. for MX25L25635E flash
it means at least the command, but usually also the address,
are transferred in single IO mode, only then do the flash
and controller switch to parallel IO for the data transfer.
