Yes, it's just single block transfer so no CS changes occurs.
I find this delays strange also, but I have no idea how to avoid them.
The same behaviour exists even when DMA is used in APB mode (write
to registers). Only using SMM with DMA helps.

I have DLYBS, DLYCS and DLYBCT set to zeros. I can try DLYBS=1 if
you wish.

Thank you for comments,
