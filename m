Currently ext4 just skips zeroing the final block entirely, which is perhaps the
most reasonable behavior, but it's wrong because it breaks truncate() semantics.
If it did zero the final block on-disk, yes it wouldn't actually be zeroes after
being decrypted, so if the file were to be extended later the extended portion
wouldn't be filled with zeroes, and more importantly even without extending, up
to the last 15 bytes of the file would be corrupted since AES-XTS encryption
operates on 16 byte blocks.  Also, the ciphertext page would likely end up in
the pagecache, which is supposed to contain the plaintext.  So if the file were
read later (which requires the key), up to the last PAGE_SIZE bytes of the file
would appear as garbage.

Yes, that's supported.

I assume you're talking about the key derivation nonce in the encryption xattr
(which is stored on-disk and is not really a "key"; although it's used as an
AES-ECB key in derive_key_aes(), that's really an implementation detail, and the
key derivation algorithm could/should be replaced with something less
idiosyncratic like an HKDF).  This is a completely separate issue, but no, as
far as I know we aren't securely erasing the nonce following a file deletion so
that someone with access to both the raw disk and the master key can no longer
derive the per-file key.  It's a good idea, though, and I think it should be
done if practical.  Note, though, that the xattr may be stored in an external
xattr block, and it also may have moved around over time --- so it may be
necessary to zero the whole inode and xattr block.
