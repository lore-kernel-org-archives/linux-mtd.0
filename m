I know. However, it's much nicer to define partitions for a specific
flash chip inside the device tree (I've sent a link to the DTS of the
BTHOMEHUBV2B to illustrate that, please have a look at it and tell
me if you'd really like that partitioning currently stored as
device-tree nodes to be migrated back to 'mtdparts=...'.)

Again, please understand that the whole production firmware can be as
small as 3.5 megs for kernel and rootfs. Of course we never use glibc
or systemd anywhere.
What you imagine to be the ways to make a initramfs really small is
what we already do for *all* our system, ie. we use busybox on top of
a very tiny libc.

In the end, do_mounts.c is already running in user-space, just the
source-code happens to be part of the kernel tree. Sure, that could
become a seperate executable binary which mounts the rootfs and then
passes control to /sbin/init. On the other hand that would add quite
some redundant infrastructure, because we already got ROOT_DEV and lots
of automagic mounting going on in the kernel.

That's excatctly what we've already been doing for initramfs-only
images, see e.g.
http://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/lantiq/xway/lede-lantiq-xway-BTHOMEHUBV2B-uImage-initramfs

So if we need an initramfs to mount the on-flash rootfs and *another*
initfamfs containing the whole system for other cases, things become
even more fishy on our side. But yes, I'm aware that this would be
possible.

Yes, it can be done. But you would have to define your flash chips in
device-tree, you may define the mtd partitions either in DT or by using
mtdparts=... in the cmdline. Now to define which MTD device to
ubiattach you will have to use ubi.mtd=X on the cmdline. If you defined
your partitions inside the of_node of the flash chip, changes there
(which do happen) may change the index of the partition you want to
ubi-attach. C'mon. This *is* messy. Just having a compatible-flag to
attach the partition would already greatly improve things.

Hauke: Maybe we should discuss the two patches individually, as I feel
that ubiattaching specific mtd partitions flagged in DT is quite
straight forward, while specifying volumes inside the ubi device might
be out-of-scope.
