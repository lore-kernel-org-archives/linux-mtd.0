Here is the nandtest run:

This is the kind of errors I got last time but I think am starting to
understand the root cause now. Tell me if I get it right: what is
understood as bad blocks above (and in nandtest) is in fact the two bad
block tables reported during boot:

 NAND device: Manufacturer ID: 0xad, Chip ID: 0xf1 (Hynix H27U1G8F2BTR-BC)
 NAND device: 128MiB, SLC, page size: 2048, OOB size: 64
 Bad block table found at page 65472, version 0x01
 Bad block table found at page 65408, version 0x01

*If* that is the case, 

 1) I think your driver works as expected

 2) I also think I should reduce partition definition from 

         partition@1800000 {
                 label = "jffs2";
                 reg = <0x1800000 0x6800000>;
         };
   to
         partition@1800000 { /* Followed by 256KB of BBT */
                 label = "jffs2";
                 reg = <0x1800000 0x67c0000>;
         };

In that case, I wonder if there some automatic way to have the
*effective* size of that last partition computed from start position,
chip size and bad block tables positions and size? Or hardcoding the
value is ok?

I took a look at devicetree bindings for MTD partitions (partitions.txt)
but found nothing. Looking at existing .dts files, I wonder if 0 as a
specific meaning:

As a side note, if I am somewhat right, I wonder how the defintion of
the partitions in for instance armada-370-mirabox.dts (introduced by
016b74660d14) would allow to effectively use the end of that partition:

         nand@d0000 {
                 status = "okay";
                 num-cs = <1>;
                 marvell,nand-keep-config;
                 marvell,nand-enable-arbiter;
                 nand-on-flash-bbt;
 
                 partition@0 {
                         label = "U-Boot";
                         reg = <0 0x400000>;
                 };
                 partition@400000 {
                         label = "Linux";
                         reg = <0x400000 0x400000>;
                 };
                 partition@800000 {
                         label = "Filesystem";
                         reg = <0x800000 0x3f800000>;
                 };
        };

Comments welcome.

Cheers,
