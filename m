I just pushed two fixups on top of the Github branch [1], can you rebase
on top of them and give me the result?

The first patch just adds the auto bus width bit in nand->options.
The second removes the faulty ->change_column(), and does the same
check with another method.

I think the ECC issue you faced was related to pages being written
*and* empty. If this guess is right, the board should boot fine with
these changes.

Otherwise, please add the DEBUG define as before in both the core and
the driver and do not hesitate to add another dump_stack() where it
crashes (if applicable).

Thanks for your help,
Miqu=C3=A8l
