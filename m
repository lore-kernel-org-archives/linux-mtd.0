Yes, I think this should be a primary aim of any 'spi-nor' framework".

Sure, the implementation here is very specific to the st_spi_fsm controller.
However, until there is something better or more generic available, I am not
sure what else to suggest.  Selecting a configuration based on a presorted list
is probably a reasonable strategy though; READ_1_4_4 is more efficient that
READ_1_1_4, and READ_1_1_4 is more efficient than READ_1_1_2 etc.

I will leave Lee to defend himself on this one ;-)

Mode data cyles are similar to dummy cycles, except they also transmit some
extended information on how the device should perform the transfer.  For
example, Spansion devices use mode data to enter/exit a "continuous read mode"
where subsequent read operations do not need to issue the read command, just
supply an address (and further mode/dummy cycles).  In practice, we have only
used this particular mode during testing; our boot-controller dislikes any form
of statefull mode!

Other controllers/drivers would certainly benefit from something similar.
However, I thought the point was that no such framework exists at present and
any spi-nor proposal is going to take time to mature.  In the meantime,
integrating the st_spi_fsm driver would provide another example of H/W that
needs to be supported by a spi-nor framework, and maybe give a few ideas along
the way.
