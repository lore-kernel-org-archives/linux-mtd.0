FWIW, the above hack doesn't do anything if these are built as modules,
AFAICT. So I guess udev's (or similar) module rules would be another
point of failure here? Not that any of us probably care too much about
this driver as a module, but just throwing it out there...

I have a feeling we'll have to solve this locally, by avoiding having
"independent" drivers handling similar compatible properties, as I
expect (despite our expectation that compatible ordering should matter)
this problem will not be solved any time soon in the generic
infrastructure.

Or we can just use a hack (as Anup is doing) to leave off the
"brcm,brcmnand" compatibility property. Unless someone has brilliant
ideas, I guess we go with Anup's hack for now.
