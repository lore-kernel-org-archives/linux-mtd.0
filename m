This patch adds a new optional DT property which enables an alternative
way of supporting memory size above 16MiB (128Mib). This new mechanism
translates the regular 3byte-address op codes into their 4byte-address
version whereas the old/default mecanism makes the SPI memory enter its
4byte-address mode, which has annoying side effects for early bootloaders.

We cannot discover at run time whether the SPI NOR memory supports the
4byte-address op codes. For instance both Macronix MX25L25635E and
MX25L25673G share the same JEDEC ID (C22019 without any extension byte).
However the first one doesn't support 4byte-address op codes whereas the
second one does.
