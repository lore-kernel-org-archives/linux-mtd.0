Unlink takes (parent directory, name), not a directory cookie.

The problem is concurrent unlink and nfs readdir.  So:

	NFS server returns readdir result with cookie X

	Somebody unlinks the entry at X.

	NFS server gets readdir request with cookie X.

Then the NFS client will get a spurious -ENOENT.

I'm not sure how best to reproduce that.... Maybe:

	Create a directory on an nfs-exported filesystem with lots of
	entries.

	Start a loop (or loops?) renaming directory entries within the
	directory as fast as possible (or deleting and creating entries;
	I assume it's the same thing for our purposes).

	read the directory from an nfs client.

I'm not sure how many entries is "lots".... Ideally you want a single
read of the directory to require the client to make lots of READDIR
requests to the server.  You could help by running:

	echo 1024 >/proc/fs/nfsd/max_block_size

before starting knfsd.  That should force it to return no more than 1K
of data in each READDIR reply.
