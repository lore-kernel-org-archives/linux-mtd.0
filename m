The point is not the necessity of swapping bytes if factory bad block 
markers are not used.
In my case, the bytes must be swapped because all previous operations on 
flash swapped these bytes :
* Flashes redboot (bootloader) via JTAG using OpenOCD which swaps bytes;
* Writes kernel and rootfs via TFTP using redboot which swaps bytes;
So to be able to read rootfs partition, mxc-nand driver have to swap 
bytes otherwise, JFFS2 detects error on partition and is unable to mount it.

I have not chosen to swap these bytes. In a training, I received redboot 
and kernel 2.6.22 with set of patches to support i.MX27 and these 
patches included swap of bytes in nand driver. So I start my development 
with this workaround and it is now impossible to get back because boards 
are already in production.
