Stop deflecting. I don't care that you didn't write this code. If you're
asking me to apply this upstream, then you own it. Or else, hire another
expert who is willing to own your drivers.

Well, I think we have a fundamentally different view of what upstream
development means, then. My job is not to worry about your company's
internal problems. My job is not to worry about your company's
development schedules. My job is not to be your on-call MTD expert.

My job is to make sure that upstream MTD contains relatively clean,
maintainable code, and to accept patches that generally improve the
codebase (i.e., bug fixes, refactoring, feature improvements).

Recall that at least one prominent kernel developer has suggested that
it's actually not in a maintainer's interests to accept random
contributors' code. The contributor's job is to give the maintainer no
reason to reject his or her code. When you repeatedly claim to not
understand the code you're sending me, that sets off warning bells that
make it significantly harder to handle your code.

Perhaps we'd all be better off if I simply removed your driver from
upstream, and you can convince your company to hire an MTD expert to
handle your upstreaming efforts.

But this is not a '101' use case, exactly. It's there because of the
peculiarities of macros, it seems. And don't pretend to understand when
you clearly did not when I first asked. (And to be clear: I did not
understand either. That's why I asked.)

No, the comment wasn't the problem, exactly. I was a bit confused, and I
wrongly assumed that you understood what you're sending me. Apparently
that was too much to assume.
