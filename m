Here I will provide just few thoughts about this new DT property. I don't
pretend this is what should be done. I still think other mtd maintainers
should be involved to discuss this topic.

First the DT property name "label" sounds good to me: it is consistent with
"label" DT property used to name mtd partitions. However, I don't think it
should be documented in jedec,spi-nor.txt but *maybe* in partition.txt as
the purpose of this new DT property seems very close to the "label"
property of partition nodes: let's think about some hard-disk device
(/dev/sda) and its partition devices (/dev/sdaX).

Besides, the concept of this memory label is not limited to SPI NOR but
could also apply to NAND memories or any other MTD handled memories.
Hence the DT property might be handled by drivers/mtd/ofpart.c instead of
being handled by spi-nor.c or by each SPI NOR memory controller driver.

Finally, I guess we should take time to discuss and all agree what should
be done precisely before introducing a new DT property because one general
rule with DTB files is that users should be able to update their kernel
image (zImage, uImage, ...) without changing their DTB: device trees should
be backward compatible. Hence if we make a wrong choice today, we are
likely to have to live with it and keep supporting that bad choice.

Anyway, maybe you could describe a little bit your use case; what you
intend to do with this label from you userspace application.

Best regards,

Cyrille
