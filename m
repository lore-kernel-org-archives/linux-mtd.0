Thanks. Unless ones spends the time being taught that or reading the code,
the logic of BBT mapping and reservation is not exactly straightforward.
Thanks for the explanation.

More news below.

ok.

ok. Will put a comment in the .dts about that.

The image is a dd from the partition itself. Trying to put it back will
obviously not work for the reason you provide above, i.e. because dd
reads to the end of the partition (including the BBT) but then during
the write operation the reserved block cannot be written back.

Well, before submitting the patches for armada-based ReadyNAS .dts
files, I decided to give each of them a try on their respective hardware
and I was somewhat lucky (if I can say so) on my RN2120 and got the
following. Note that the NAND chip is the same but the SoC on the NAS
is different (dual-core armada Xp mv78230 on RN2120 instead of Armada
370 on RN102). The same tree is used in each case with the same MTD
related config options:

So I decided to increase CHIP_DELAY_TIMEOUT in the driver as you
suggested in a previous email (HZ instead of 2*HZ/10):

root@thin:~# nandwrite -p /dev/mtd4 mtd4ro 
Writing data to block 0 at offset 0x0

And then to 25*HZ/10 (I know it's a lot):

So I guess, if you have any (non hardware destructive ;-) ) idea, I now
have a platform on which the problem is reproducible. Meanwhile, I will
try and do the same on my RN104 (should be the same as the RN102).

Cheers,
