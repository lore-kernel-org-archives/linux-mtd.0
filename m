Is it possible to addend the kernel command line with device tree? Some
vendor boot loaders are adding the mac address to the kernel command
line and I would like to get it. Like Daniel said replacing the vendor
boot loader is dangerous because sometimes recovery means to desolder
the flash chip.

In the end I would like to be able to specify from where to mount the
root filesystem in device tree. The partition layout directly on the
flash chip is already defined in device tree.

The U-Boot from the Intel / Lantiq SDK currently loads the kernel from
an UBI partition and then the kernel should also load the rootfs from an
UBI partition. You can also flash the images from the boot loader the
boot loader takes care of placing your image into the correct UBI
partitions. In this case the boot loader is aware of the partition
schema and also the UBI schema.
