I miss your point: as you yourself note, the proposal is limited to
single-queue devices, exactly because BFQ is not ready for
multiple-queue devices yet.

It is not missing.  As I happened to report in previous threads, we
made a script to measure that too [1], using fio and null block.

I have reported the results we obtained, for three classes of
processors, in the in-kernel BFQ documentation [2].

In particular, BFQ reached 400KIOPS with the fastest CPU mentioned in
that document (Intel i7-4850HQ).

So, since the speed of that single-socket commodity CPU is most likely
lower than the total speed of a multi-socket system, we have that, on
such a system and with BFQ, you should be conservatively ok with
single-queue devices in the range 300-500 KIOPS.

One of the main motivations behind NVMe, and blk-mq itself, is that it
is hard to reach the above IOPS, and more, with a single I/O queue as
bottleneck.

So, I wouldn't expect that systems
- equipped with single-queue drives reaching more than 500 KIOPS
- using SATA or some other non-NVMe as protocol
- so fast to push these drives to their maximum speeds
constitute more than a negligible percentage of devices.

So, by sticking to mq-deadline, we would sacrifice 99% of systems, to
make sure, basically, that those very few systems on steroids reach
maximum throughput with random I/O (while however still suffering from
responsiveness problems).  I think it makes much more sense to have as
default what is best for 99% of the single-queue systems, with those
super systems properly reconfigured by their users.  For sure, other
defaults are to be changed too, to get the most out of those systems.

Thanks,
Paolo
