No, i replied to your mail that was sent just to me.

sysfs files are meant to have just a single value. Some have a list of
values of the same type, but a file that needs a nontrivial parser
(even sscanf) is not allowed in sysfs, by convention.
There is also the technical limitation of the size to a single page,
which makes it hard to write variable size data.

It's basically the same as debugfs -- actually I once started a patch
to make it a single function call to instantiate a debugfs-like
file system, but I never finished that patch.

debugfs is a bad idea here because it is not meant for stable interfaces
but rather ad-hoc stuff. In a distribution kernel, debugfs is supposed
to be empty.

ok.

ok, makes sense.

I think there is still another option, which would be to generalize
the profiling interface so it can work with arbitrary file systems.
I'm sure that other people can benefit from that as well, e.g. for
optimizing boot times on disks. For such a general interface,
a per-file ioctl would fit best, and then file systems can implement
it if they want, or it can be moved into VFS.
