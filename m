As mentioned in the cover letter,

"Additional features that currently boards in mainline does not make
use of like, waitpin interrupt handling, changes to leverage revision
6 IP differences has not been incorporated."

Priority in this series is to convert into a driver, get all boards working
on mainline. Once all boards are working with gpmc driver, these features
which are not required for currently supported boards can be added later.

Waitpin information is indeed a part of cs as far as boards are concerned,
it is only that it gets propogated to device

Only intention is not to alter default waitpin polarity value, i.e. if
any board does make use of it w/o knowledge of Kernel, I don't want to
break it, there may be an argument saying that the board code is buggy,
while if some board does so, it is, but don't want to break working one.

Here unless user explicitly set the flag, it does nothing on polarity

Initially it was done per CS, the problem happened while trying to
convert tusb6010. It had multiple CS, but using same waitpin. Problem
with incorporating this onto CS is we have to sacrifice on wait pin
conflict prevention capability. The code now handles case of wait pin
conflict per device, the code can be extended to have multiple
wait pin per device also. But I prefer to defer it to later, not as
part of this series, as this feature what you asking for is not required
for any of the existing boards. I can add it in this series if there is
a strong opinion in the community for the same in this series.

Policy that is being followed here is first sit, then straighten legs, ;)

It means anything other than resources like memory & irq, happened for
want of better name, if you have one, name it, will put it.

Ok, it was required for OneNAND, as it needs to reconfigure

Well, you also know that I am big fan of it; difference of opinion,
my preference is to keep loop control statements together with "for",
unless there is a cry from community that it should not be this way.
I believe that it is not that much unreadable.

num_device is something that I never wanted to add, was happy with,
NULL entry termination, only because of your repeated comments,
I added this. And this additional check now prevents NULL dereference.

As far as platform are concerned, it is associated with cs, it is only
that while configuring CS, it is propagated such that it is done once.

On device tree matters, my mind is next to blank, thanks for mentioning it.
