I'd like to get this fixed in one way or another, but I'm not
particularly attached to my specific workaround.

If you don't think anyone will be able to reduce the number of
map_word instances on the stack, please add my patch so at least
we get rid of the warning and make it less likely to hit the bug.

An alternative might be to optionally move the map_word_and/clr/or/...
operations out of line for large sizes of map_word, so we don't
have all instances on the stack at once.
