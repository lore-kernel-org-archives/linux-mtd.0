Apologies, I wasn't able to review this efficiently as promised earlier.
But, I'll continue Brian's email so that all feedbacks are collated under
single thread.
Some earlier reviews on this version of patch can be found here..

Are you sure you want to use same timeout value for all operations
like ERASE, READ, WRITE ? because
(1) There is wide variance between:
- BLOCK_ERASE:  max(tBER) =3D 10ms) for MT29F4G08 Micron NAND
- PAGE_ERASE: max(tPROG) =3D 600usec for same Micron part.

(2) The value of HZ varies across kernel versions and hardware platforms.

I suggest you pass the timeout value in call to bch_wait_seq().
And this timeout value should be like 2x of typical value of which you foun=
d
during ONFI parsing, or from DT

Are you sure you want to use hweight8 ?
hweight32 or something should give better performance, plz check.
because this piece of code (check_xx_bitflips) sometimes becomes

You should use chip->ecc.strength here instead of 'bch_ecc_strength[nandi->=
bch_ecc_mode]'
Though both mean same in your case, but chip->ecc.strength is generic
term used from NAND framework point of view.

Yes, updating mtd->ecc_stats is important, something like ...
	if (ret < 0)
		mtd->ecc_stats.failed++;
	else
		mtd->ecc_stats.corrected +=3D stat;
And it should be done either for both erased-page and programmed-page,
Otherwise you can do that in bch_read(), common path for all chip-_read().

*Important*: You shouldn't call internal functions directly here..
Instead use chip->_read() OR mtd-read() that will:
- keep this code independent of ECC modes added in your driver in future.
- implicitly handle updating mtd->ecc_stat (like ecc_failed, bits_corrected=
).
- implicitly take care of address alignments checks and offset calculations=
.

<Same applies to other places where you have directly used bch_read_page())

Important: 'emiss_nandi_select' is called at every READ, WRITE and ERASE op=
eration.
Do you really want to ioremap() and iounmap() here ?
Shouldn't this be part of somewhere in probe(), where your ecc-scheme
and controller configurations are initialized ?

Sorry, this review got delayed from my part..
But I hope I have covered most of the review in this and earlier responses.
if you are able to clean most of these then should be ready for 3.17+.

Please re-send the next version in similar squashed format, as its easy for=
 review.
And once Brian is okay, may be then you can re-send individual patches.


with regards, pekon
