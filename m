From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

By design, the keys which userspace provides in the keyring are not used
to encrypt data directly.  Instead, a KDF (Key Derivation Function) is
used to derive a unique encryption key for each inode, given a "master"
key and a nonce.  The current KDF encrypts the master key with
AES-128-ECB using the nonce as the AES key.  This KDF is ad-hoc and is
not specified in any standard.  While it does generate unique derived
keys with sufficient entropy, it has several disadvantages:

- It's reversible: an attacker who compromises a derived key, e.g. using
  a side channel attack, can "decrypt" it to get back to the master key.

- It's not very extensible because it cannot easily be used to derive
  other key material that may be needed and it ties the length of the
  derived key closely to the length of the master key.

- It doesn't evenly distribute the entropy from the master key.  For
  example, the first 16 bytes of each derived key depend only on the
  first 16 bytes of the master key.

- It uses a public value as an AES key, which is unusual.  Ciphers are
  rarely evaluated under a threat model where the keys are public and
  the messages are secret.

Solve all these problems for v2 encryption policies by changing the KDF
to HKDF with SHA-512 as the underlying hash function.  To derive each
inode's encryption key, HKDF is executed with the master key as the
input key material, a fixed salt, and the per-inode nonce prefixed with
a context byte as the application-specific information string.  Unlike
the current KDF, HKDF has been formally published and standardized
[1][2], is nonreversible, can be used to derive any number and length of
secret and/or non-secret keys, and evenly distributes the entropy from
the master key (excepting limits inherent to not using a random salt).

Note that this introduces a dependency on the security and
implementation of SHA-512, whereas before we were using only AES for
both key derivation and encryption.  However, by using HMAC rather than
the hash function directly, HKDF is designed to remain secure even if
various classes of attacks, e.g. collision attacks, are found against
the underlying unkeyed hash function.  Even HMAC-MD5 is still considered
secure in practice, despite MD5 itself having been heavily compromised.

We *could* avoid introducing a hash function by instantiating
HKDF-Expand with CMAC-AES256 as the pseudorandom function rather than
HMAC-SHA512.  This would work; however, the HKDF specification doesn't
explicitly allow a non-HMAC pseudorandom function, so it would be less
standard.  It would also require skipping HKDF-Extract and changing the
API to accept only 32-byte master keys (since otherwise HKDF-Extract
using CMAC-AES would produce a pseudorandom key only 16 bytes long which
is only enough for AES-128, not AES-256).

HKDF-SHA512 can require more "crypto work" per key derivation when
compared to the current KDF.  However, later in this series, we'll start
caching the HMAC transform for each master key, which will actually make
the real-world performance about the same or even significantly better
than the AES-based KDF as currently implemented.  Also, each KDF can
actually be executed on the order of 1 million times per second, so KDF
performance probably isn't actually the bottleneck in practice anyway.

+ * HKDF-Extract can be skipped if the input is already a good pseudorandom key

+ * shorter than HKDF_HASHLEN bytes.  Thus, we still must do HKDF-Extract.
+ *
+ * Ideally, HKDF-Extract would be passed a random salt for each distinct input
