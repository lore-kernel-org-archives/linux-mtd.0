This should go through Florian's Broadcom device tree tree and is based
on that. These additional device are in his tree.

To my knowledge all supported SoCs have a NAND controller, but some are
not using it. There are some device with only serial flash, but I do not
have one with only serial flash. If it is save we can activate it on all
SoCs and boards.

Ok, I can change it that way. The nand-cs0-bch8.dtsi sonds good.
Currently I do not have a complete overview, but I think at least the
vendor driver only supports Chip select 0 as far as I think and the ecc
values are auto detected and calculated by some strange algorithm I
haven't fully understood.

We should talk about this in the patch adding the binding, I will adapt
this depending on the result of the discussion.
