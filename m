Hi Wolfram,

Thanks for taking the initiative to summarize the current status.
Also thanks to Huang Shijie for all the work done so far.

flash_eraseall of mtd1 works for me.
ubi_format of mtd1 always gives the dma timeout
reading/writing of mtd0/1 always gives the dma timeout
I have seen dma timeout during boot if i try to enable ubi rootfs (so
that's the same issue as dma time during read/write).

I don't use mtd0 for testing as this contains my uboot.

I tested using Huang's .config and the Linaro git but still see
exactly the same issue.

On my target, the mxs-dma is working for sdio until the gpmi-nand
gives a timeout. After that the dma for sdio is *not fully* working
anymore.

I was not able to test you uImage. It ended with a "Kernel panic - not
syncing: read error". See (off list) mail from last week.

Anything is good for me.
Could also be useful to make sure we test on the same HW as much as
possible and are using the same source tree.
HW I have:
- mx23evk rev C1
- mx23evk rev B2
- own target hw using mx23 lqfp-128 chip and different type of ddr and nand=
.
