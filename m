I almost suggested that, and then looked more closely at where this
reset register is located, and it happens to be in the NAND controller
itself (IPROC IDM which is the iProc SHIM to the NAND controller), so
coming up with a reset controller driver and a reset controller consumer
for that simple use case sounds both unnecessary and complex.

The core of the discussion is about disguising this NAND controller
reset as a way to preserve previously configured NAND timings, which is
at best a hack and an unstated dependency with the firmware.
