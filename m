Hi all,

This series introduces the support for the Marvell Berlin nand
controller. It is based on top of v3.19 and was tested on the
Marvell Berlin BG2Q DMP board.

The support is added into the existing pxa3xx nand controller. Some
additions were done in order to get this controller working:
- Support for a non mandatory ECC clock has been added.
- The Berlin nand controller needs to poll the status register.
- Sequences of commands are quite different in order to perform write
  operation.

Changes were done in order to avoid impacting other controllers using
this driver, but I'd like people actually using the pxa3xx nand driver
to test theses patches to ensure no harm was done. A specific Berlin
nand cmd function has been added to deal with most of the Berlin
specific code.

Because of a bug in the Berlin clock driver, this series requires the
fix provided by Jisheng Zhang, which is already in v3.19-rc6
(b71e8ecd57c8aae5b1815782c47b74ffe3efc09a).

Thanks!

Antoine

Changes since v1:
        - Added a fallback to NULL when looking for the 'nfc' clock
	- Added the clocks in the bindings documentation
        - Reworked the DT
        - Removed non needed RNDOUT command
        - Used the standard RESET command
        - Fixed the flash type matching order
        - Remove all non tested flash types (only one left)
        - Added a check to explicitly not support nand chips with small pages
        - Remove useless checks for clocks in the probing function
        - Various clean up
