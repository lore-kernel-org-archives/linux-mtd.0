On some earlier rounds of off-lis review, we did consider making the
SD/MMC controller a clock provider.  But forcing it to be instantiated
was kinda ugly too, especailly because there are several instances of
the MMC IP, and only one of them shares the clock with the NAND, so only
one of them needs to be a clock provider. :(

Thanks.  We did consider a few options, and found this one to be the
least worst of a few options.
