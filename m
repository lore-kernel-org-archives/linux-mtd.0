To explain the origin of this series of patches I would say that at first
I was only supposed to write a driver for the Atmel QSPI controller. I was
using (ans still use) a sama5d2 xplained board with a Micron n25q128a13
memory. Hence, testing the driver, I found that the probe failed inside the
old micron_quad_enable() function.
Indeed nor->write_reg() was successfully called to clear the Quad Enable bit
in the Enhanced Volatile Configuration Register but immediately after
spi_nor_wait_till_ready() failed.
The reason was that the Micron memory was switched to its Quad Mode and then
expected all the following commands to use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol. However
the Atmel QSPI controller driver was not aware of this protocol change and
kept on using the SPI 1-1-1 protocol.

So in the very first version of this series of patches, I inserted a call of
spi_nor_set_protocol(), a new function simply calling an optional hook,
between the nor->write_reg() and spi_nor_wait_till_ready() calls. This way
the (Q)SPI controller driver was now notified about the protocol switch and
can eventually adapt to this change.

After some discussions on the mailing list, it appeared that using such a
hook to handle protocol changes would required to insert calls of the new
spi_nor_set_protocol() function before all the calls of nor->read_reg(),
nor->write_reg(), nor->read(), nor->write() and nor->erase().
Indeed some manufacturers like Spansion use different numbers of I/O lines
depending on the type of operation:
- Fast Read: 1-1-4
- register read/write: 1-1-1

So the addition inside struct spi_nor of the new reg_proto, read_proto,
write_proto and erase_proto fields was prefered to the first
spi_nor_set_protocol() proposal. This fields are set once for all by
spi_nor_scan(). SPI controller drivers have to worry about their values only
if they claim to support Dual or Quad protocols through the 'mode' argument
of spi_nor_scan().

Then about the Micron case, I did test it and it didn't work without patching.
To be cautious, I wondered whether it might have work with a
different configuration/SPI controller because I don't want to break
something working. I wondered about a mean for the SPI controller driver to
detect the protocol change. Maybe parsing the SPI message and checking the
command op code. However it looked a highly inefficient method and also it
simply can not work since the very same op code, for instance 0x6B, is used
by both the 1-1-4 and 4-4-4 protocols.
So my conclusion was it could not have worked before: I don't have to worry
about breaking the support of Quad protocols for Micron memories.

I don't think there is a real need to revert Bean's commit since this series
fixes the issue anyway. However if you feel it would be better to revert it to
start from a cleaner base, I'm fine with it. Just let me know your choice so
I can adapt my series before sending the next version.


About the Macronix case, I still don't have any memory sample to test.
However, reading some memory datasheet (again and again), my understanding
has changed a little bit: setting the Quad Enable (QE) non-volatile bit in
the Status Register doesn't mean enabling the Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI)
as I thought.
Two dedicated op codes are used when sending the required commands to
enable/disable the QPI. Once the QPI enabled, the memory expects ALL commands
to use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol. Enabling the QPI requires the QE bit to bit set
first in the Status Register.
However the QE bit is also required to use the SPI 1-1-4 protocol: QPI must be
disabled in that case.
Setting the QE bit only disables the Write Protect and Hold features: the two
associated pins then become the IO2 and IO3 lines, needed by Quad SPI
protocols.

Finally for the Winbond case, I don't have memory from this manufacturer
yet so once again I refer only to some datasheets: it looks like Winbond
memories use a pattern of behaviour very closed to Macronix' one.
Indeed, some Quad Enable non volatile bit must be set inside the Status
Register. Also two dedicated op codes are used to enable/disable the QPI mode.
The QPI mode requires the QE bit to be set and, once enabled, all commands
must use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol.
However the two op codes to enter/leave the QPI mode are not the same as
those of Macronix and both manufacturers use different offsets for their
QE bits.

What I've planned to do to support Macronix and Winbond memory is to sill
use the spi_nor_read_id() function to guess the current protocol. If the
caller of spi_nor_scan() asks for Quad SPI support through the 'mode'
argument, I will use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol if the QPI mode is already
enabled, the SPI 1-1-4 protocol otherwise: I won't change the state of the
QPI mode. Indeed, if spi_nor_read_id() has succeeded in reading the JEDEC
ID, the current state of QPI mode is supported whatever it is.

Currently not all drivers support numbers of dummy cycles which are not
multiple of 8 bits. Especially this is the case of the m25p80 driver.
Other drivers, those supporting more numbers of dummy cycles still support
multiple of 8 bits. So now the spi-nor framework always  sets to 8 the number
of dummy cycles to be used by updating some Micron *volatile* register.
All drivers can deal with a value of 8. This value is almost always the
value used before. It is large enough to fit the highest SPI bus clock
frequencies but still provides good performances.
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was the only used value before.
And since the driver updates a volatile register, the configuration will
still be the same after reset for bootloaders.
In fact it should not change what worked before, it only gives a chance to
recover from bootloaders which would have used "strange" values of dummy
cycle number.
For instance, the romcode of the sama5d2 sets this number of dummy cycles to
10 for all Micron memories to limit the risk of incompatibility with memory
timing requirements. This romcode cannot be updated and tries to
support as many QSPI memories as possible within a limited code size: we
cannot afford using tables indexed by JEDEC ID but only by manufacturer ID.
However a value of 10 is not such a kind of value as expected by Linux
drivers. A value of 8 gives a chance to use the m25p80 driver to manufacturers
who don't want/can't develop a driver dedicated to their QSPI controller.

As a second thought, another solution is to only read the current value of dummy
cycle number and simply set use this value to initialize nor->read_dummy.
The assumption is now that is the value was fine for the QSPI controller during
the bootloader phase it's still fine under Linux as long as a driver can handle
this QSPI controller.

Please let me know which strategy you prefer for my next series.

I've already tried to split the series a bit more. I had troubles making
patches smaller without breaking functionnal dependencies but I'll try
to split it again before sending the next series.
