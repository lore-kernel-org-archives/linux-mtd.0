Actually, running xfstests was how this cropped up in the first place.

The UBIFS rename and xrename functions allready call
fscrypt_setup_filename with lookup=0, however there are other tests
before that call and moving them around causes generic/419 to fail
at a different place where EPERM was expected.

Therefore I concluded that the safest way to fix this might be to
simply copy the way the checks are handled in ext4.

With recent xfstests + UBIFS support patch, after applying this patch,
generic/419 passes.
