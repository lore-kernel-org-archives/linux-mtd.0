That's just more confusing :)

Re-reviewing the SPI framework helpers suggests to me that their usage
scheme is actually not too bad. And it's actually pretty similar to your
current naming scheme.

I guess (1) is not that bad in the end. I at least prefer it to (2).
Sorry for the bikeshedding!

So are these last few patches still applicable as-is, or should I await
a new submission?

Thanks,
