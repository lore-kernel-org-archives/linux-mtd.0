Thanks :) And thanks for testing this. I believe I suggested to you that
I'd be releasing this "soon" several months ago. Better late than never,
I guess?

I'll take a look at all your comments/questions when I get back into the
office, but a few pointers:

1. IRQs are a touchy subject; for platforms I've supported, I've found
it best if the NAND interrupt bits are handled in an irqchip driver.
Particularly, that's one of the use cases for
drivers/irqchip/irq-brcmstb-l2.c. If you can arrange the NAND
enable/ack registers to act as a second-level interrupt controller, that
should hopefully solve your problems.

But if BCM4708's NAND interrupt registers can't be shaped into a sane
irqchip driver, then we can probably handle them in a per-SoC extension
of the driver. I have code already that supports another chip in this
way, so I can point you that way if the first suggestion doesn't work
out.

2. Endianness is a known issue with at least one other platform. On many
chips (spanning MIPS LE, MIPS BE, and ARM LE), NAND has been integrated
such that data can just be read/programmed in the native endianness
through the FLASH_CACHE registers (as this driver does), but there are a
few (on ARM, LE) that require a be32_to_cpu()/cpu_to_be32() swap. I'm
considering supporting DT properties like one of the following:

	brcm,nand-cache-be
	brcm,nand-cache-big-endian
	brcm,nand-cache-reverse-endian

You might also check (though I might actually be better equipped for
this) if there is a separate register that can tell the NAND data bus to
automatically endian-swap data into the native endianness. I know a lot
of the buses and peripherals in BCG, at least, are designed such that
either (1) they can work naturally in the CPU's native endianness or
else (2) they can be configured to swap endianness into either format.

But if such a register does not exist, then we'll definitely have to do
something like the DT property above.

Do the bad block markers look OK without extra endian swapping? I'm
wondering whether the swapping will have to occur on both the
FLASH_CACHE and SPARE_AREA registers.

3. I was told that there were only 2 or 3 chips that were released with
a v6.1 NAND controller, and BCM4708 wasn't one of them. Apparently I was
told wrong... I'll have to see if there are any other quirks we should
be accounting for.

Brian
