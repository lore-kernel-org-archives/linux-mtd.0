I missed the DT bit, sorry. the DT bindings say:
  - compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-gpmi-nand"
so if FSL invented their own buggy bindings, they need to get them
through Rob :) IMO for MX7, this should be "imx7-gpmi-nand" , unless
there's some incentive to discern the solo/dual chips and/or there
is a future imx7 coming up with different GPMI NAND block version.

IMO the GPMI controller in solo and dual should be the same, so there's
no need to have quirks for it.
