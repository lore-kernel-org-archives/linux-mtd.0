OK, so to make these statements *much* shorter:

 * Micron "Quad Mode" means putting the flash in a 4/4/4 mode

 * Spansion (and all others?) are using 1/1/4 modes

Correct?

The naming is confusing enough here... so in your words, "extended"
means 1/1/{1,2,4} (i.e., command, and maybe address, use 1 line, but
data goes on 4)? And "quad" means 4/4/4?

OK, so I think your patch is broken:

How did you test this? Specifically, this can't possibly have worked
with a regular drivers/spi/ controllers, since:

 (a) you're enabling 4/4/4 (i.e., "Quad mode") on the flash but
 (b) m25p80_read() only sets .rx_bits for the data; i.e., it's using
 1/1/4 (i.e., "Extended mode")

I'm tempted to essentially revert that, as it looks essentially
untested. It would be nice to have a cleaner baseline before trying to
extend it with Cyrille's work.

Cyrille, what do you think? Is my analysis at all correct here? (Sorry
if this is addressed elsewhere; there's a lot of text in this
conversation, but I'm getting hung up very early.) And if so, does it
hurt to just drop Micron "Quad mode" (4/4/4)?

(AIUI, this won't exactly be a panacea, since you mention bootloaders
that start us off in quad mode, so we can't use single I/O 0x9f READ
ID.)

OK. That's odd, but I guess it doesn't matter much. It just makes it a
little less obvious what's going on.

Do you have any data to about the speed? And you haven't addressed the
risks. There are definitely risks. Cyrille looks like he's trying to
address the risks (e.g., use volatile modes whenever possible), but it
doesn't seem that you are.
