Well yes, the processor architecture has probably not much to do with
the IP version.

However, that particular problem, the wiring up of the CS/RB signals, is
probably more SoC (as a whole) specific, and how that is done might have
some relation which architecture is in use...

I do not have a strong opinion on this, so we might as well go with the
run-time distinction using compatible. If there are different IP
variants within one architecture, we anyway would need to do that.

Ok, just checked, I can use the data field of the of table to assign
specific data to a compatible string, similar to how pxa3xx_nand.c does
it.
