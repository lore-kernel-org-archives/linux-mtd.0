Hm, I'm not so sure. I've seen a lot of recent drivers that still
provide this low-level interface, while providing means to optimize
things if the user care about implementing software support for it.

And AFAICT, these 'high-level controllers' are not a new thing.

True.

I also agree on this aspect. Though what you consider an evolution with
these 'high-level' controllers is in my opinion a regression.

By supporting only a subset of what NAND chips actually support, and
preventing any raw access, you just limit the compatibility of the NAND
controller with rather old NAND chips. For example, your controller
cannot deal with MLC/TLC NANDs because it just can't send the private
commands required to have reliable support for these NANDs.

Yep, except what you call simple controllers are actually not
simpler than yours, they just provide a raw interface in addition to
their advanced/high-level logic in order to let the software support
features that were not supported when the controller IP was designed.

This is IMO a much saner design than limiting the interface to higher
level abstraction, which are likely to be compatible with only a subset
of all the NAND devices available out there.

I understand this constraint, and I know some controllers are really
like this, but before deciding to move those controllers to some
'high-level NAND' framework, I'd like to make sure they are really not
providing this raw interface.

I've been told many times that NAND controllers were not supporting raw
accesses (disabling the ECC engine when accessing the NAND), and most
of the time it was false, but the developers just didn't care about
supporting this feature, and things like that make the whole subsystem
unmaintainable.

I fear the same will happen with this high-level interface: once we'll
add it, people will just decide to re-implement everything on their
own, and support only the set of feature they need. And we'll end-up
with another set of unmaintainable drivers.

So my answer is yes, I'm okay providing this high level NAND controller
framework, but I'd like to make sure drivers going in there are not
abusing it, just because it's simpler to implement a driver for their
specific use-case. And given the CMD registers exposed by the Evatronix
IP I had the feeling that this low level interface was available...
