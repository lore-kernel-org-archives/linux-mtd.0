Hi Arnaud,

First of all: thanks for such great testings!

Hm, so something *is* working properly. Notice that mtd4 has its 8 last blocks
marked 'bad' becuase it holds the bad block table.

If you don't mind running a few more rounds, then it would be nice to do:

  $ nandtest --passes {N}

So we run the test a few more times, just to be sure.

Hm.. so you get errors when writing to mtd4 blocks from 800 to 823.

Is that completely reproducible, IOW do you get always the error
on those blocks?

And what happens if you write directly to those blocks only?
(you can use nandwrite --offset)

These 8 blocks (824-832) that has been skipped are the ones marked
as 'bad' because they hold the bad block table.

Yes and no :-) The bad block table consists of 8 blocks at the end
of the flash device. These blocks are marked as 'reserved' and nandtest
or any other userspace writing/erasing tool will skip them.

Hence, the bad block table is what explains the skipping of the group
of blocks [824..832]. However, you're getting errors when writing
data to [800..823], and it's a "Ready timeout" condition. I'm not sure
exactly what's going on, but we can say that:

  * Either the waiting time is not enough, or ...

  * The commands (maybe some race) were badly issued so there's nothing
    to wait at all.

To check the former, you only need to hack the driver like this, and
then re-try the nandwrite:

diff --git a/drivers/mtd/nand/pxa3xx_nand.c b/drivers/mtd/nand/pxa3xx_nand.c
index 3d143fe..9bb7d35 100644
--- a/drivers/mtd/nand/pxa3xx_nand.c
+++ b/drivers/mtd/nand/pxa3xx_nand.c
@@ -39,7 +39,7 @@
 #include <linux/platform_data/mtd-nand-pxa3xx.h>

+#define	CHIP_DELAY_TIMEOUT	(10 * HZ/10)
 #define NAND_STOP_DELAY		(2 * HZ/50)
 #define PAGE_CHUNK_SIZE		(2048)
 
It's just a test.

To check about the latter, I cannot think of anything but adding printk
all over the place and inspect the command sequence.

Brian: Do you have any better idea?

Thanks again for these tests and for your patience!
