Well, I like to explicitly put parenthesis even when operator
precedence guarantees the order of the calculation ('*' is preceding
'+').

For the parenthesis around (cmd) and (pos), they are required to
guarantee that things like ATMEL_NFC_CMD(x + y, cmd) are working
correctly.

I agree with this one, it's uneeded.

See my comment about ATMEL_NFC_CMD().

Ditto.

Because I don't want to duplicate the code done in
atmel_nand_pdata_get_gpio() each time I have to convert a GPIO number
into a GPIO descriptor, and that is needed to support platforms that
haven't moved to DT yet (in this case, avr32).

Yes, I must admit I didn't polish the code in PMECC, and most of it has
been copied from the old driver.
We could probably use BIT() in a few places.

Again, this has been copied from the old driver. I'll have a closer
look.

What are you talking about? nand_chip hooks?

I think so, but again, this is really vague, what kind of
open-coded functions do you think could be replaced with core libraries
helpers?

I'm not asking you to review the whole driver, but you started to
comment on the code without pointing clearly to the things you wanted
me to address.
