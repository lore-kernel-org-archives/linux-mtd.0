Thank you for sharing more details. I could reproduce this issue and reach out
to what you mentioned. In order to resolve this, I wrote a patch for f2fs first
to act like ext4 for easy backports. Then, I expect a global fscrypt function
is easily able to clean them up.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: check entire encrypted bigname when finding a dentry

If user has no key under an encrypted dir, fscrypt gives digested dentries.
Previously, when looking up a dentry, f2fs only checks its hash value with
first 4 bytes of the digested dentry, which didn't handle hash collisions fully.
This patch enhances to check entire dentry bytes likewise ext4.

Eric reported how to reproduce this issue by:

 # seq -f "edir/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345%.0f" 100000 | xargs touch
 # find edir -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
100000
 # sync
 # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
 # keyctl new_session
 # find edir -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
99999
