Maybe we should drop this whole thing and add it when this is actually
required.

Are there any users of this in the wild currently ?

What is the purpose of doing this per-byte bit reverse instead of
storing th bits in the original order ?

$ git grep bit.reverse Documentation/devicetree/ | wc -l
0

So we don't have such a generic binding . It's up to Rob (I guess) to
decide whether this is SoC specific and should've altr, prefix or not.
IMO it is.
