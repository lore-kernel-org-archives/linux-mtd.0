I certainly miss some background, I'm not sure I understand how this
works: bus_type seems suitable for pluggable devices that possess a
device ID which matches against a driver that will then get loaded.  But
ubiblk devices are created by ubiblk.
So, are you suggesting to move ubiblk_create() to UBI and add a
MODULE_ALIAS to ubiblk (actually, I don't know what it would contain) ?

(I just saw that you sent an email while I was writing this one ;
however, I still understand. I'll try and read how scsi does that).

Ah, yes, I guess we need to hold a vol_lock in ubiblk_remove() ?

This is the way it's implemented in v4, right ?

BTW, those are the changes made so far since v4:
 * Add missing headers (they are included by other headers but it seems
   to be good practice not to rely on that).

 * Remove an macro rendered useless with the linked lists

 * correct some formatting in kerneldoc comments

 * introduce refcounting to avoid multiple opens or closing a UBI
   volume while still in use

 * make checkpatch happy about assignation inside a condition

 * use DEFINE_MUTEX for devlist_lock
