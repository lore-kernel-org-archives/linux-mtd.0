Actually, fast read opcode will always be fast read opcode. I do see your 
concern, but then, until there is a way to probe for supported opcodes and 
features, you'll end up having to describe your chip properly.

Of course, the list of IDs built into Linux is cool and can be used to toggle 
the fast read I think, but what about running older linux kernel with a new chip 
it doesn't support? The DT props could be easily used to describe even the new 
chip then and there won't be any problem -- compared to "internal ID table".

Best regards,
Marek Vasut
