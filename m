That sounds good. The ECC mode is currently "selected" in the driver
to be the one that "makes sense". In follow up patches we'll add a
proper DT binding, so this ECC mode can be set by the user.

The latter is an improvement over the former (adding more flexibility),
so there won't be any regressions.

Just to confirm: I consider this patchset to be OK as it is, and I expect
it to either get merged or receive some request for changes.

Oh, and by the way: we __really__ need someone to test for regressions on PXA.
