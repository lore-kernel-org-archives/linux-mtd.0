I am all in favour to be able to swap the factory bad block marker with
the position the mtd framework expects it.

That according to our understanding are bytes 0x7d0 in the main area
and byte 0x0 in the spare area.

So you are swapping the factory bad block marker with some position
where the mtd layer does not expect the bad block marker. With this
you preserve the factor bad block marker, but do not use it to detect
bad blocks.

In this form the patch is simply not correct and should be dropped.
