Hi Jonas,

taking your comments into account I'm about to test a new series with
additional patches to handle the Read ID command in multiple I/O protocols and
relying on new members in the struct spi_nor:

 * @erase_proto:	the SPI protocol used by erase operations
 * @read_proto:		the SPI protocol used by read operations
 * @write_proto:	the SPI protocol used by write operations
 * @reg_proto		the SPI protocol used by read_reg/write_reg operations

	enum spi_protocol	erase_proto;
	enum spi_protocol	read_proto;
	enum spi_protocol	write_proto;
	enum spi_protocol	reg_proto;

This way, the read(), write(), erase(), read_reg() and write_reg() hooks can
check the relevant protocol member so the spi-nor framework doesn't need to
call spi_nor_set_protocol() before any command.

Also the op codes for read, page program and erase commands will be tuned
depending on the memory manufacturer and the selected SPI protocol.

I'm likely to publish this new series tomorrow after my tests on a Micron
memory.

Best Regards,

Cyrille
