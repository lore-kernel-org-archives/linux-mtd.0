The mmap and truncate patches were basically the same for each filesystem, but
yes it's fine for them to go in separately.  Richard, can you take for ubifs:

	ubifs: don't bother checking for encryption key in ->mmap()
	ubifs: require key for truncate(2) of encrypted file

and Ted can you take for ext4:

	ext4: don't bother checking for encryption key in ->mmap()
	ext4: require key for truncate(2) of encrypted file
