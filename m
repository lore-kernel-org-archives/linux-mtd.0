Sorry for the late reply.

As the three platforms that use this have all been broken for around
ten years, it seems reasonable to assume nobody is going to miss the
current implementation, but I'd leave it up to the individual platform
maintainers.

If we remove all three, that would also give us more flexibility
regarding the interface definition for any future users of the feature.
I think the most likely to use it is the Renesas RZ/A1H platform
with its 10MB of on-chip SRAM, and this one doesn't work with the
current method anyway.
