That's not going to work. If the notifier add increase the MTD reference
count it can never be removed again. What could work would be to
propagate the nvmem device ref counting down to the MTD device, but that
sound complex and would require some non-trivial locking to still allow
for an "always succeed" removal.

Under which condition would these be triggered? That sound more than is
needed. I would just use the above add along with:

 int (*remove)(struct mtd_info *, void *);

And add a list of successfully added notifiers, along with their
data pointer, to the MTD device. That's simple and would also remove
the need for notifier to have a private list of their instances as I
had to do here.
