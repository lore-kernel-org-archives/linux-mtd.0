Even just a read_page_raw implementation doesn't help. The controller
requires the ECC to be configured at command issue time, and the driver
issues the command in the cmdfunc callback. The function
nand_do_read_ops calls cmdfunc before ecc.read_page_raw...

I could just bail out in the NAND_CMD_READ0 case, and execute the
command from within the ecc.read_page_raw callback function. A bit
hacky, but that would work.

For that case, it would be nicer if cmdfunc somehow provides the
information that a raw read is requested, we would have that information
in nand_do_read_ops. However, that would need an extension of the
cmdfunc interface... Also, not sure how that should look like.
