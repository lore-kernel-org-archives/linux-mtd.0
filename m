+* NAND SoC control node:

+The NAND controller is integrated differently on the variety of SoCs on which it
+is found. Part of this integration involves providing status and enable bits
+with which to control the 8 exposed NAND interrupts, as well as hardware for
+configuring the endianness of the data bus. On some SoCs, these features are
+handled via standard, modular components (e.g., their interrupts look like a
+normal IRQ chip), but on others, they are controlled in unique and interesting
+ways, sometimes with registers that lump multiple NAND-related functions
+together. The former case can be described simply by the standard interrupts
+properties in the main controller node. But for the latter exceptional cases,
+we can describe these extra SoC-specific integration hardware via the following
+node, referenced from the brcm,brcmnand node above.
