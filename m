I think the distro people don't like that too much. Afaik they enable
all drivers as modules, and hence the NAND driver would end up as kernel
module in x86 distros... 

Reminds me that I wanted to send a patch to add the dependencies of
STE_MODEM_RPROC, I recently stumbled upon the remoteproc/ste_modem_rproc
kernel modules on my distro, which both are actually not really useful
on x86 :-)

I think this is the better solution, and Sebastian suggested that too. I
will implement that in the next patch revision...
