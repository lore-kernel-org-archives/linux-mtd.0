Brian,

Can we start discussing this patchset?
I realize is a big series, but better starting sooner than later! :)

In particular... (see below)

.. this one seems to me like the most conflicting patches as
they extend the ECC, adding BCH. Could you review them and
provide any comments?

Huang: It seems gpmi-nand driver has some similar quirks,
so I'd like if you could take some time to review my patches.

I realise that you might be busy with your own patches, but the
best way of having them cross-reviewed is by doing some review
on others work.

Thanks!
