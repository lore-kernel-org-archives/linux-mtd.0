If we can not parse out the SPI NOR commands, we can not quickly find the
LUT which already programmed last time.

Yes, I really need to send an OPCODE_RDSR in the middle of sending page
data (Page Program) to the chip.

The NOR chip can accept the data input from 1-byte to 256bytes.
So it can handle this.

Please see the datasheet of the NOR:
www.spansion.com/Support/Datasheets/S25FL128S_256S_00.pdf


Please see the page 100, the Quad I/O Read, the figure 10.37 shows
the dummy.

The dummy is just a delay in a command sequence.
The dummy maybe only several clock cycles, less then 8 bit.

As the time goes on, the SPI devices or SPI controllers have become more=20
and more complicated.


If the Quadspi controller can not know the SPI NOR commands explicitly,=20
it can not fill the
LUT correctly, and at last it can not work.
