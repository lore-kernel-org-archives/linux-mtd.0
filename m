Absolutety, my point was, it shouldn't hurt from a functional POV, but
yes it will definitely impact performances.
But that's not the first thing I would rework of if you're concerned
about performances: when doing PIO read/write, the page read/write
operations (I mean the part reading the internal fifo) are all done in
interrupt context (called from pxa3xx_nand_irq), and doing this will
prevent any other interrupt from taking place while you are
draining/filling the FIFO :-(.
An alternative would be to move this part into the read/write_buf
functions, but that's a lot of work...

Best Regards,

Boris
