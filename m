We even want per-device information, because device manufacturers
might "port" image tags to other architectures, e.g. Linksys used the trx
partition table originally from bcm47xx also for ar71xx devices, wich
normally uses u-boot uImage (+ cmdlineparts).

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. If the bootloader doesn't touch the dtb,
there is no issue, but e.g. ipq806x bootloaders will overwrite any pre-
existing bootargs in the chosen node with the bootloader one.

At OpenWrt we do have hacks like "bootargs-replace" and "bootargs-extend",
but this doesn't feel very clean either.

And sometimes you even want a mix of them, e.g. on devices with support
for multiple images you want the information from which image it booted
(which is usually exposed through bootargs), but still use your own
proprietary layout. Or the bootloader passes the ethernet mac addresses
through the commandline, etc.

Right. For (1), I think adding a way for specifying parsers to use through
commandline for non-OF and a OF-way would be the way to get away from a
driver centric assignment.

(2) is a lot harder, because we also have to think about precedence. If
there are both cmdline and ofpart parititions, which one should trump? And
what about the platform specific parser(s)?

Also I noticed a thing which I don't like about the current "linux,part-probe"
(or my proposed mtdparsers commandline flag) at all: we define parser names,
but we should define partition table names, which are well defined in a
document somewhere.

So maybe for the of-part, maybe we could make it "similar" to the stdout
thing:

aliases {
	sflash0 = &sflash0;
	sflash1 = &sflash1;
	nand = &nand;
};

chosen {
	...
	mtd-partition-table-type = "nand:fixed-layout",
				   "sflash0:commandline",
				   "sflash1:bcm47xx-trx";
};

Which makes it also clear that this is configuration data.

The commandline version could be then mtdtabletypes="<mtdname>:<table-type>[;...]"

And then translate the table type names to their parser names (maybe parsers might
also support more than one partition table type).

This would make a "clean" separation from the linux-internal parser names.
