ok.

But I am sure that I will _SUPPORT_ the driver for several years. :)

sorry.

I do not think it is a good solution to package all the code in a
file. Every one thinks in different ways.

If i create a new driver, there will be more duplicated code. Because the
new driver can share all the code except that it should have its own=20
hal-imxXX.c file.

The i.MX cspi driver is just a small driver. GPMI driver is much bigger=20
then it.
But still thanks.
