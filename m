Hi Lee,

Sorry for the delay.  I have now had a quick look through the patches.  Just a
couple of points :-)

* stfsm_probe(): stfsm_fetch_platform_configs() needs to be called *before*
config() -- config() is based on platform capabilities.  Conceptually,
stfsm_fetch_platform_configs() should be called before stfsm_jedec_probe(), and
FLASH_FLAG_32BIT_ADDR should be moved out of stfsm_fetch_platform_configs(),
placed just after stfsm_jedec_probe() but before config().

* fsm_wait_busy(): logic not quite correct if we get a P_ERR or E_ERR error
after a timeout.  I am also not sure about returning (uint8_t)-EIO.  For what
its worth, this is what I did in response to Brian's comment about the race
condition:

static uint8_t fsm_wait_busy(struct stm_spi_fsm *fsm, unsigned int max_time_ms)
{
	struct fsm_seq *seq = &fsm_seq_read_status_fifo;
	unsigned long deadline;
	uint32_t status;
	int timeout = 0;

	/* Use RDRS1 */
	seq->seq_opc[0] = (SEQ_OPC_PADS_1 |
			   SEQ_OPC_CYCLES(8) |
			   SEQ_OPC_OPCODE(FLASH_CMD_RDSR));

	/* Load read_status sequence */
	fsm_load_seq(fsm, seq);

	/*
	 * Repeat until busy bit is deasserted, or timeout, or error (S25FLxxxS)
	 */
	deadline = jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(max_time_ms);
	while (!timeout) {
		cond_resched();

		if (time_after_eq(jiffies, deadline))
			timeout = 1;

		fsm_wait_seq(fsm);

		fsm_read_fifo(fsm, &status, 4);

		if ((status & FLASH_STATUS_BUSY) == 0)
			return 0;

		if ((fsm->configuration & CFG_S25FL_CHECK_ERROR_FLAGS) &&
		    ((status & S25FL_STATUS_P_ERR) ||
		     (status & S25FL_STATUS_E_ERR)))
			return (uint8_t)(status & 0xff);

		if (!timeout)
			/* Restart */
			writel(seq->seq_cfg, fsm->base + SPI_FAST_SEQ_CFG);
	}

	dev_err(fsm->dev, "timeout on wait_busy\n");

	return FLASH_STATUS_TIMEOUT;
}

and:

static int fsm_wait_seq(struct stm_spi_fsm *fsm)
{
	unsigned long deadline = jiffies +
		msecs_to_jiffies(FSM_MAX_WAIT_SEQ_MS);
	int timeout = 0;

	while (!timeout) {
		if (time_after_eq(jiffies, deadline))
			timeout = 1;

		if (fsm_is_idle(fsm))
			return 0;

		cond_resched();
	}

	dev_err(fsm->dev, "timeout on sequence completion\n");

	return 1;
}


* "MFD" creeps into a few commit logs ;-)

Cheers,

Angus
