Hi, Brain

I put  more code here to make it clearer:

arch/arm/boot/dts/sama5d3.dtsi:
nand0: nand@60000000 {
             compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-nand";
             ...
             ranges;
             ...
             nfc@70000000 {
                 compatible = "atmel,sama5d3-nfc";
                 ...
             };
         };

drivers/mtd/nand/atmel_nand.c
int atmel_of_init_port() {
    ...
    /* load the nfc driver if there is */
   of_platform_populate(np, NULL, NULL, host->dev);   # <--- Manually 
populate the sub node (NFC node) to load NFC driver
   ...
}

static int atmel_nand_nfc_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
     struct atmel_nfc *nfc = &nand_nfc;
     ...
     nfc->is_initialized = true;
     dev_info(&pdev->dev, "NFC is probed.\n");
     return 0;
}

atmel_nand_probe() {
    ...
    res = platform_driver_register(&atmel_nand_nfc_driver);  # Register 
NFC driver.
    ...
    if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF) && pdev->dev.of_node) {
       res = atmel_of_init_port(host, pdev->dev.of_node);
       #       ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^  In this function, it will populate the 
NFC node shows in above code block.
       #   It triggers the NFC driver's probe() function. Which will set 
the 'nand_nfc.is_initialized' as true.

    } else {
       ...
    }
    ...

    if (nand_nfc.is_initialized) {               # now we know the NFC 
driver is probed.
       ...
    }
    ...
}

in summary, the following flow to make sure NFC is initialized in 
atmel_nand_probe():
    atmel_nand_probe() {
       Register NFC.
       dt property check. That populates the NFC dt node.
           Via the NFC compatible string, system find the registered NFC 
driver, so call the NFC probe() function.
           NFC probe will initialized the NFC.
       Check NFC is initialized or not.
    }
