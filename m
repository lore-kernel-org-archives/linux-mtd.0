I do not need the SLC/MCL info. But i do need the ECC strength for the BCH.
Currently i compute it myself based on the ECC chunk size to be 512 bytes.
It's ok now.

But the ONFI nand MAYBE has its own requirements, such as some ONFI nand
requires '24-bit ECC per 1080 bytes of data'(see 
MT29F64G08CBAAA,MT29F128G08CEAAA).
In this case, setting the ECC chunk size to 512 bytes maybe is not 
proper. It's better to
set the ECC chunk size to 1k, and set ECC strength to 24bit.

So, add the ECC strength to nand is worthful ( at least, it's useful for 
ONFI nand) .

I meant the the code can not get sufficient info for ONFI nand.

But the current code can parse out the info for ONFI nand now.
though it does not parse out all the info.

The same idea as mine. :)   I also thought it's better to store all the 
ID bytes.

at least the ECC strength is needed.

I am not satisfied with the current code.
I wish I could add the  code to parsing out  the ECC strength of ONFI, 
and something else.
But I have no time to do this. :(
