Yes, you are right. I have to change it.

I am not sure, that's why I am asking for help. Looking at 
Specification, they seem to be similar enough. Ezequiel told me that 
pxa3xx-nand driver should be more or less compatible (using
"marvell,armada370-nand" string for the compatible property).

As always, you found it. After changing it :

Ezequiel,

Yes, it initializes the controller.
