There is a bug in nand prefetch read routine, which comes into effect
only if nand device is a 16-bit device (as we have in zoom boards).
This bug is effective only with below combination of conditions:
1. nand deivce, in use, is a 16 bit device
2. nand driver supports 'subpage' read
3. SW ECC is in use

This was not seen old  kernel (ex: .23), because when, in early days,
we tested this (nand prefetch read in LDP boards) there was no
'subpage read' support.
Later when we had subpage read in (.27) kernel, we had hw ecc enabled
always in our internal tree. So, we missed this bug.

Here is a patch to fix this issue:
