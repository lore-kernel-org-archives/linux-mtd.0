This name sounds _extremely_ Linux-specific, and that's not the direction I'd
like to see bindings take.

If the patch you referenced changed the layout without maintainng backwards
compatibility, it sounds like it is broken and has caused a regression.

This is a work around, not a fix.

I'm not very familiar with MTDs. Where exactly does this ECC info come from? Is
it data internal to Linux, or is it probed from the device itself?

Why are we telling people to do that with no description as to when to do so?
Can we not just fall back to this instead?

This looks like it could be reorganised to fall back if necessary.

Thanks,
Mark.
