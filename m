In ubifs_lookup() we handle two cases:
1. lookup of a bigname, both fscrypt_name->hash and ->minor_hash are valid.
    ->hash is r5(diskname) and ->minor_hash is the secondary hash, AKA cookie.
   UBIFS fed this hashes in ubifs_readdir() to fscrypt.
2. lookup of a non-bigname, in this case we compute r5(diskname) and
use the diskname
    itself for lookups.

So, in case 1 we avoid collisions by using a 64bit key and in case 2 by using
the 32bit key plus a linear search and memcmp() of diskname.
