Well, if there was any use for that, then yes, we should have that.
However, if root=/dev/mtdblockX is set, the filesystem type simply
doesn't matter as it is being probed and thus there simply is no
real need for that.

In some rare cases the bootloader may make use of JFFS2 and a certain
(/boot) partition is thus required to be JFFS2 no-matter-what. In that
case I'd agree, there should be such a thing as "jffs2,file-system" set
in DT (but that's a very rare corner case and abuse would probably
prevail over ligitimate use-cases).

In the end, the classication as "is an MTD user" isn't relevant for
this debate imho.

It's definitely inside the grey-zone of early-userland... Doing things
which need to be done to mount the root filesystem are traditionally
the exceptions of things which are user-land and yet happen inside
the kernel before executing init.

Correct, but in case of filesystems, it is only done for the specified
partition/device. Probing all partitions sounds nice, however, please
keep in mind that MTD partitions may overlap and there may be
left-overs from previous UBI devices. Simply trying to ubiattach *all*
available MTD devices will need quite some extra work to handle all
potential outcomes of trying to attach non-UBI or
broken/corrupted/wrongly-sized UBI partitions.
Generally, I believe that's actually the only good alternative, but I
doubt it can easily made as robust and reliable compared to hinting
which mtd device to ubiattach via the devicetree.


Cheers
