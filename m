In fact second patch from this serie (drop of drivers/mtd/maps/ceiva.c)
should be commited through the mtd tree and will bring no conflicts in
either case. And either the first patch (port of ceiva to physmap) or complete
dropout of ceiva should come through the ARM tree, again bringing
no conflicts. So with these patches we are safe :)
