Hm, I don't agree here. From my POV, a period is something used to
describe cyclic operations. If you take a clk, the period encodes the
time required a clk cycle (a rising and a falling edge).
Here the timings you're passing are not cyclic at all.

I'd rather use clk_cycles, or just cycles then.

It depends on the kernel coding style rules, and AFAIR they use the
TODO and FIXME (in capital letters) keywords.

Actually, I was just asking for a flag definition. You can keep the
assignment here till we find a proper solution to extract it from the
read-id (or ONFI information).
