I do not think all the parsers are or will be completely safe when they
are trying to parse other data. Some random block could get mixed up
with some vendor header format and then you get wrong partition layout.

Currently some flash drivers have the parser order hard coded and I do
not think that is a good idea, if we have device tree.

Yes I will add a comment.

Sorry I did not check, I just amused that it is documented because it
was already there, I will add.

Will fix that.

parse_mtd_partitions() often gets called by the driver with a hard coded
list and I wanted to make it possible to overwrite this list through
device tree.

I do not get this.
cmdlinepart is one of the default parsers, if you haven't specified any
you will get it. It could be that you do not want the cmdlinepart
parser, so I think it should be possible to deactivate it, like though
device tree when you do not specify it in the list of parsers.
