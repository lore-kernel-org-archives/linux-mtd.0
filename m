Sure they can, then you need to assume that everyone who uses the
kernel is a kernel developer, which is not the case.

Please think on a user's perspective too, where people want just to
get the kernel from kernel.org and use it without doing any hacks to
it.

The whole point of this discussion started when you stated the reasons
for not applying this patch of the thread:

"1) The pin confliction between gpmi and lcdif remains.
2) I intend to freeze the board file updates, as we are on the way to
  device tree."

1) is easily understood and can be fixed

2) is what we have been discussing.

So not accepting patches to mx28 board files while mx28 dt is not in
place will at least block: GPMI and SPI for mx28.

I have it locally and I was ready to submit it till I read this
thread. I haven't made the mxs spi driver dt aware.

Since there is no dt support for mx28 yet, I cannot submit it now, so
this will have to wait.

It is like the "chicken-and-egg problem".

Excellent, that's good news and we come to an agreement  :-) Thanks!
