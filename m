^^ That part isn't strictly true. While READ ID data only comes out on
the lower 8 bits, that doesn't *actually* mean you can't get valid data
from a 16-bit bus in general; you just have to drop the upper 8 bits. That's
what these two commits did for read ID and parameter page read commands:

    mtd: nand: force NAND_CMD_READID onto 8-bit bus

    mtd: nand: don't use read_buf for 8-bit ONFI transfers

But I presume *this* statement is actually true. This NAND controller doesn't
exactly give us a fully-flexible READID / read_byte / read_word command, as it
works at a higher level than that (although LOW_LEVEL_OP gives us this
flexibility now). I could imagine (though I never tested 16-bit NAND) that
16-bit READID is broken.

BTW, did you ask the HW designer about this? It'd be nice to be 100% sure.

Anyway, as I noted on the cover letter, I've pushed this patch.

Thanks,
Brian
