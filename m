That doesn't answer the question.  What is the dependency - what is it
about this patch that something else depends on?  Your cover letters
just say you'd like to do this but don't mention dependencies at all and
when I asked the question last night you said the same thing.  I've not
seen the rest of the series...

It probably *is* stable but I'm not enthused about people pulling
unsigned tags.  I might rebase, though - I'm going to finalise the tree
in the next few days.

You just mentioned it as a preference (you said it's something you'd
like to do), please if you're doing this sort of cross tree thing be
explicit about what the inter-tree relationships are.  If things need to
go in via the same tree say so explicitly (and ideally say way this is).

The main reason I applied it straight away was that Javier mentioned
that it was a bug fix and it's near the merge window and these random
ARM cleanup serieses never seem to go in quickly.
