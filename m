One last question and I'm done: is something like that acceptable?

	compatible = "<vendor>,<old-soc>","<vendor>,<new-soc>";

This can happen when someone adds support for an unsupported feature
on a brand new SoC, and then someone else use the same driver for an
older SoC embedding the same IP but still wants to add a new compatible
just in case these 2 IPs appear to be slightly different.

Here the order of compat strings is no longer following a clear rule
like 'most-specific compatible first' or 'newest IP/SoC version first',
it's completely dependent on the order these IPs were supported in the
OS (Linux). I'm perfectly fine with that BTW, just want to make sure
this is authorized.

Regards,

Boris
