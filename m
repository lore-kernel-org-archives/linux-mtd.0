The bootloader can easily modify the command line in the dt, but
things like device mac address should be modified in the ethernet
device node if possible.

This is a  bit of an ad-hoc binding, I wouldn't use that as
an example for how to do things elsewhere.

Right, that goes a bit too far. File system type etc should clearly
be detectable from either the partition table or the partition itself.

A few more thoughts on various things that came up in the discussion
so far (so I don't have to reply to each of them separately)

- The /chosen and /aliases nodes do configure the OS to some degree,
  and historically we have used them to specify the device names that
  show up in the kernel (e.g. on MacOS and AIX) as well as the rootfs
  itself

- The device tree should give us enough information to identify the
  root partition by a GUID from the kernel. This works on all block
  devices (at least with MBR and EFI partition tables, probably many
  of the lesser known ones as well) and it should really also work
  on UBI.

- MTD partitioning unfortunately does not seem to have a widely used
  method for identifying partitions from what's stored on the flash,
  unlike block devices, so whatever we normally have in the partition
  table has to be stored in DT. This really sucks, but I don't know
  what else to do about it.

- The UBI design was originally meant to cover the entire flash
  device and provide the partitioning information inside. I have not
  looked at UBI in a long time (actually not since before embedded
  PPC moved to DT), but I would hope that this case works without
  any DT magic.
