Sorry, no. I can't review code that doesn't compile, so I'm only now
getting to some of the review.

Looks like you forgot to include <linux/mtd/stm_nand_bbt.h>.

And your code is not bisectable. I think patch 7 and 8 should be
reordered (with some tweaks, perhaps):

Bisectability test results for configuration "arm-multi_v7_defconfig,arm,arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-"

Failed to build patch #7: 5936df30f5e1 mtd: nand: stm_nand_bch: add support for ST's BCH NAND controller
Configuration: "arm-multi_v7_defconfig, architecture arm".
