Hmm.  It sounds like MLC flash, but you say you have SLC.  It could be
that some bus signalling is marginal?  Could you reduce the clocks a bit
on this device and see if the behaviour changes?  I am pretty sure that
stuck-at-zero errors will stay that way.

I would love to get back to this controller code to fix some issues you
noted and bring in the changes to the u-boot review.  Unfortunately, I
keep getting stuck with legacy hw issues.

fwiw,
Bill.
