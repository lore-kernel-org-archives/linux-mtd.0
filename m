Ok, it will be marked with TODO

By device, it is referred to gpmc device which only gpmc driver is aware,
the peripheral device's driver is not at all aware.

Let me check this, here only intent was to play safe, as I have
only two boards to test.

Not too familiar with OneNAND, from the code it has been understood
that to set into sync mode, first it may have to set to async mode, read
frequency from OneNAND, then setup sync mode for that frequency.

Even if a single device sets write protect, kernel will log it.
