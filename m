Hi all,

are there other works in progress to enhance the QSPI support inside the
spi-nor framework?
Do you have any suggestion about what should be done and how to do it?
Is there any discussion on this topic? If so, I would be interested in taking
part of it so I could synchronize my work with other developers' efforts.

Brian, Mark, Marek, with this series I've removed the Atmel QSPI controller
driver to focus only on the common spi-nor framework. I will send a dedicated
series later for the Atmel QSPI controller once we all agree on an update of
the framework API to add support to other QSPI memory manufacturers such as
Micron or Macronix.

Currently, it looks like the spi-nor framework only works with Spansion
memories. For instance, without the patches of this series, I can't use the
Micron n25q128a13 embedded on sama5d2 xplained boards.
So I hope we will find a way to make it work!

Best Regards,

Cyrille
