The reason why we need define different ecc type and ecc strength is
for those different kind of ecc strength could give different
performance cost. For data safe consideration, the higher of ecc
strength would be safer. But you must notice that the higher ecc
strength would bring to us more performance downgrade. For flash that
only need 1bit correction per 512 bytes, we certainly don't
need the 8bit ECC, or we would suffer from the performance.

One table with the ECC strength description would solve all the
problem we have, and also no risk in the driver robustness.
