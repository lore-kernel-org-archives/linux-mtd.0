Yes, that's what it does now.  The question is, in the "bigname" case why
doesn't f2fs check the 16 bytes of ciphertext in fname->crypto_buf too?  f2fs
doesn't even use 'minor_hash'; it can't possibly be the case that there are
never any collisions of a 32-bit hash in a directory, can it?

I actually tested it, and it definitely happens if you put a lot of files in an
encrypted directory on f2fs.  An example with 100000 files:

# seq -f "edir/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345%.0f" 100000 | xargs touch
# find edir -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
100000
# sync
# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# keyctl new_session
# find edir -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
99999

So when I tried accessing the encrypted directory without the key, two dentries
showed the same inode, due to a hash collision.

Actually, checking the last 16 bytes of ciphertext currently wouldn't even help
for those filenames since it's all the same, as they share a long common prefix:

# ls -1  edir | head -n 4
_++09VCAAAAgsQQf6Q5YgLgoO4f3PPSfb
_++1UWDAAAAgsQQf6Q5YgLgoO4f3PPSfb
_++2HAAAAAAgsQQf6Q5YgLgoO4f3PPSfb
_++4UxBAAAAgsQQf6Q5YgLgoO4f3PPSfb

But that's the bug, since the last two AES blocks are swapped when using
ciphertext stealing.  We should at least be using the second-to-last block in
which case we'd see:

# ls -1  edir | head -n 4
_++09VCAAAAw9VONwQEXOVv3RR,kOAKwB
_++1UWDAAAAAHDi7c3QZxbiltjOo1m0,F
_++2HAAAAAAAfd1Vx0oC31SmhzYpaYfwz
_++4UxBAAAAwZxcWjzORdAef50FB9sKY4

(In either case there are still a few A's at the beginning since f2fs doesn't
set 'minor_hash'.  That's okay, but only if collisions are ruled out by other
means.)

Yes that's a mistake.  Actually it seems that 'namehash' is the same as
'fname->hash' when 'fname->hash' is nonzero, so the code should just be:

	if (de->hash_code == namehash &&
	    fscrypt_name_matches(fname, d->filename[bit_pos],
				 le16_to_cpu(de->name_len)))
		goto found;
