[Full quote for context]

What about resurrecting CONFIG_DEFAULT_IOSCHED for MQ as well and
leave it default to mq-deadline but give bfq, kyber and none as a
choice as well?

The question is shall we only do it for single queue devices or for
native MQ devices as well if we go down that road?

I understand the embedded floks will want a different interface than
udev, but from the non-embedded point of view I'm with Jens and Jan
here, let udev do the job.
