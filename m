Might. I have a patch already, but I failed to boot a BE kernel, so I
kept it out for now. If you don't mind, I'd prefer patching something
like this once it's testable on ARM BE. This *is*, however, extensively
tested on MIPS (LE and BE) and ARM (LE).

I suspect we wouldn't need a DT property but could just special-case
MIPS BE, as you note.

We use mb() before kicking off DMA or other commands.

Huh? Wouldn't that break just about every driver in existence? And how
is writel() any different than __raw_writel() in that regard? From
include/asm-generic/io.h:

static inline void writel(u32 value, volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
        __raw_writel(__cpu_to_le32(value), addr);
}

And BTW, splitting isn't possible on ARM. From
arch/arm/include/asm/io.h:

static inline void __raw_writel(u32 val, volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
        asm volatile("str %1, %0"
                     : "+Qo" (*(volatile u32 __force *)addr)
                     : "r" (val));
}
