Sorry, you are correct, it breaks the API not the ABI. I understood that
such changes were still to be avoided.

Right, but I don't think it needs the complexity of the shrink_ecc
function from Kevin's patch. The old ioctl should return an error
(possibly with a kernel message) if the requested nand chip has > 64
bytes ecc. Otherwise it should just copy upto 64 bytes into the old
nand_ecclayout structure and return.

Any new structure should be totally independent and should, IMHO, have
an arbitrary sized array for the ecc. It should have its own new set of
ioctls, one for getting the size of the ecc and one for getting the
actual ecc data. Though I can't remember if ioctls support arbitrary
sized arguments to make this possible.
