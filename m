Documenting supported memory parts is not the same as documenting chip names
that can be used in the 'compatible' DT property. Here we are talking about
DT bindings.

I you want to pass the checkpatch test then use the "jedec,spi-nor" string
alone. Please have a look at the drives/mtd/devices/m25p80.c file in the
m25p_of_table[] array: this is the value to be set in the 'compatible' DT
property.

SST25 memories do support the JEDEC READ ID op code (0x9F), so there is no
reason to use any other value but "jedec,spi-nor" for the 'compatible' DT
property.

Adding useless values would go to the wrong direction:
3094fe121e75 ("mtd: m25p80: remove unused flash entries from id_table")

As I've explained, the only new values that should be added in the m25p80.c
driver and the jedec,spi-nor.txt files are those for memory parts not
supporting the JEDEC READ ID op code (0x9F). No exception to that rule.

Also please note that there are far more entries in the spi_nor_ids[] array
from drivers/mtd/spi-nor/spi-nor.c than in the m25p_ids[] array from
drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c. Indeed, names in the spi_nor_ids[] array are
mostly informative and should not be considered as values for the
'compatible' DT properties.
For 'compatible' values, you should consider the m25p80.c driver only.

Moreover, we should refer to the comment in the m25p_ids[] array, applying
to the sst25vf016b memory part:

"""
Entries that were used in DTs without "jedec,spi-nor" fallback and
should be kept for backward compatibility.
"""

This is for backward compatibility purpose only, with some existing DTs,
likely before the "jedec,spi-nor" string was introduced.
However new DTs using values like "sst25vf016b" are _wrong_ and that's
why this is not documented is the jedec,spi-nor.txt file.

Best regards,

Cyrille

This is a deprecated usage. I agree some DT use such patterns; this is
legacy and we have to deal with it however it doesn't mean that it is the
correct binding. New device trees should use "jedec,spi-nor" alone.

That's something I plan to clarify in the jedec,spi-nor.txt file once
4.15-rc1 will be released.

And which prefix should be use ? I see both "microchip,sst25vf016b" and
"sst,sst25vf016b" in device trees.
