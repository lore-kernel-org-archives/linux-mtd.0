Yes, I have a BCM963168VX (BCM63168) but all the Broadcom code refers to
this SoC as BCM63268. This is the only one with these registers in the
source code of similar MIPS that I have.

int kerSysGetChipId() {
...
        /* Force BCM63168, BCM63169, and BCM63269 to be BCM63268) */
        if( ( (r & 0xffffe) == 0x63168 )
          || ( (r & 0xffffe) == 0x63268 ))
            r = 0x63268;

This is the correct way to do partitioning, there would be a
"partitions" block with no address/size that contains the partitions as
child nodes. [Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/partition.txt]

I think they're also implicit so you can just remove those two lines.

I've created a bcm963268part driver so there won't need to be any
partitions in DT for bcm63268.
