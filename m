Thanks a lot for testing!

Oops. I guess I was thinking of a 64-bit system and didn't even notice
the difference between 4 and 8 byte accesses here. I wonder where I have
my mind sometimes.

I guess that would be equal to calling memcpy_fromio().

Ok, that is a noticeable difference. For scale, what is the size of that partition?
If this is something that actually affects people, it might be worth also trying
memcpy(), which should be better at saturating the bus, but might be wrong here
(if alignment the alignment requirements on the external bus are stricter than
what memcpy does) or it might not make a difference at all if the code is already
ideal.
