oops, I'll fix this warning in next version.

I use CodeSourcery 2010q1, and no any error reported. So it seems 
related with the compiler.

 From the log, I think the error is caused by the dynamic 2d array: 
smu[cap + 2][2 * cap + 1]. which is used to calculate the sigma table.

Since the smu is allocated when driver is probed, and the length of the 
smu depend on PMECC correction capablity. So when I declare the type of 
smu by following line: (cap is declared as const type)
          int16_t (*smu)[2 * cap + 1];
That make Sparse compiler not happy, since the cap is a variable. so it 
reports an error. But for this case, the CodeSourcery works fine.

For fixing this compile error, in next version,  I will use 1D array 
instead of 2D array, for instance: all smu[i][j] changes to smu[i * num 
+ j].  // in this line, num equal to 2 * cap + 1.
I think in such way, all compiler should be happy. :)

When I send out the next version of the patch, Could you please test it 
about above fix? since I don't have Sparse compiler in my hand. Thanks.
