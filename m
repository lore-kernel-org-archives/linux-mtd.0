Since in my commit: a41b51a1f7c15a1b00f30a3ad2d0373ad51b883d (mtd: at91: 
add dt parameters for Atmel PMECC), it already added following 
properties to DT documentation:
   atmel,pmecc-cap
   atmel,pmecc-sector-size
   atmel,pmecc-lookup-table-offset
so in this patches series, NO. 2 and 3 just add it to at91 board's dts 
file according to the DT documentation.

Indeed, this patch series make a little bit different from the DT 
documentation, that is: the ROM code mapping size are smaller than the 
DT documentation example.
But original DT documentation example still works.

So I think the DT documentation's explanation are proper for this patch 
series. It seems I don't have to update the DT documentation so far.
