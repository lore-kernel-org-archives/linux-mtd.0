Yes, the fact that row 7 (the 8th row, since there is a row 0, but I get
what you mean) should be removed was pretty much what I had guessed. But
what about the other strange things I found? To reiterate, this is my
PRxSy register content (zeroes shown as -):

PRxS0  33--3--3--3333--
PRxS1  33--3--3--3333--
PRxS2  33--------------
PRxS3  -3--------333---
PRxS4  33--------------
PRxS5  3---------------
PRxS6  33--33-33333333-
PRxS7  --3-3--3--------
PRxS8  -3---3--3--3----
PRxS9  --3-3--3-33-333-
PRxS10 3--3------------
PRxS11 3-----3---------
PRxS12 ----------------
PRxS13 ----------------
PRxS14 ----------------
PRxS15 ----------------

So, PRxS7 matches row 8 (DDR2 port 1) in the datasheet.
And PRxS8 matches row 9 (DDR2 port 2) in the datasheet.
But PRxS9 is not matching row 10 (DDR2 port 3)!
And PRxS10-11 match rows 11-12 (APB 0-1) in the datasheet.

But also look at PRxS3 (Internal ROM), there's a missing 3 in the
first slot (A5)! Maybe the priority of that one can't be changed
for some fundamental reason? But there is no hint to that effect
in the datasheet AFAICT...

I think I tried to arrange for that last time around. Not sure though,
so I will try again next week...

Not sure what level of detail you are after?

We use W949D2CBJX5E LPDDR1 memories from Winbond. Years ago, I wrote some
LPDDR1 patches for at91bootstrap to driver/ddramc.c (which predate the
current upstream support) and to board/sama5d3xek/sama5d3xek.c (which doesn't
to this day support LPDDR1 upstream, but I guess it shouldn't and that we
should have a board of our own, so that part isn't really clean and also the
reason I never upstreamed it). Anyway, some other trivial glue was also
needed, but the meat are in those files. I just had a brief look at the
LPDDR1 support in the upstream ddramc.c file and our code is very similar.
But I did notice some differences and I will look into if that difference
is something that matters. I can show provide patches if you think they
are relevant?

We use this in the sam-ba .qml file when we flash the devices with sam-ba and
the nandflash applet (don't know if it's relevant, but it shows that we have
a 16-bit bus):

        device: SAMA5D3 {
		name: "sama5d3-linea"

		aliases: []

		description: "SAMA5D3 Linea"

		config {
			nandflash {
				ioset: 1
				busWidth: 16
				header: 0xc0902405
			}
		}
	}

*time passes*

Oh dear ... you said NAND *DMA* configuration. Nothing special that I know
of. So, the default? Anything specific I should check?

Further, we are not playing any video. The artifacts are visible on a
static screen on an otherwise "idle" system (i.e. just showing whatever
on the screen and accessing the DRAM with DMA is enough to trigger the
visual glitches).

Cheers,
Peter
