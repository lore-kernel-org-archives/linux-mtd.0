Sounds reasonable. Will do.

Thanks for the tip. Will do.

OK. I'll look into overloading waitfunc.

The generic code in nand_command_lp() sends NAND_CMD_STATUS immediately after 
NAND_CMD_RESET. According to the datasheet you must wait tWB (200ns max) 
before sending any command, including NAND_CMD_STATUS. Setting chip_delay is 
not enough as I explain above. That's way I added digicolor_nfc_wait_ns(). 
That timed wait is what I referred to. You are right that the 
digicolor_nfc_dev_ready() call is not needed here. Will remove.

That's what the datasheet says. There is no mention of data FIFO in the 
datasheet.

I'll look into this for v2.

OK. Will do.
