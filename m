There needs to be some way of saying if the additional data lines are
actually wired up or not; it could be a negative property (flagging if
the lines are not present) but that runs the risk of breaking systems
if a driver acquires the ability to support extra data lines but a
system doesn't have it.

This should be a generic property for all quad devices to use, though,
since the same thing applies everywhere.

This is fine, the device tree is for the board as a whole not for the
individual chips - if the board doesn't support quad read the device
tree shouldn't configure the chip for quad mode.  It really needs to be
a slave property since a system could opt to connect some devices with
extra data lines and some without on the same SPI bus.

That bit does need to be fixed in this driver, yes.  The SPI core now
has quad mode support.
