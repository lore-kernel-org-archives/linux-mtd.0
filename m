Just FYI, I used block2mtd in the patch I wrote for xfstests-bld (i.e.
kvm-xfstests/gce-xfstests).  I didn't consider nandsim because I wasn't aware of
it.  If you take over the patch you probably should consider both options and
choose the better one.

Okay, great!

Well, the issue is that the operation is expected to fail for two separate
reasons, each of which has its own error code.  So I'm not sure it makes sense
to enforce that filesystems prioritize one reason over the other.  The test
could accept both ENOKEY and EPERM (but not any other error) by running 'sed -e
s/Required key not available/Operation not permitted/' on the command output.
Note that the reason generic/398 tests this operation is that it was
specifically a way that ext4 and f2fs actually did, in fact, allow violating the
"all files in a directory use the same encryption policy" constraint.

Alternatively I think you could simply update UBIFS to move the
fscrypt_has_permitted_context() checks in ubifs_rename() down below the calls to
fscrypt_setup_filename().  i.e. there's no need to add a new check; the existing
ones are sufficient, they just aren't in the order the test expects.
