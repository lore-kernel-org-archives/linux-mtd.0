ok.

Ok, so I'd label those devices with an M-Systems vendor prefix
("m-systems", I guess, if we don't already have one).

For the devices sold during this time where nothing has changed other
than the label, I'd keep the M-Systems vendor.

These new devices I would label with a sandisk vendor-prefix.

I'd label something as the original brand it shipped under, unless
there's a compelling reason not to. We can add notes in the binding
documentation to make the bindings easier to find where a device has
been labelled by different manufacturers.

I was more concerned with the identifying information that we can
acquire from the device than the precise sequence of steps that have to
be performed to extract that information.

You mention that the size of the flash is variable (it could be 64MB,
256MB, etc), but this isn't described in the binding. Therefore I assume
there is some mechanism by which I can query this from the device?

Are there other parameters that vary across instances? Even those for
which we currently don't care? If so, can these be queried from the
device?

No, the unit-address is the bit after the '@' on the node name. I'm
asking for:

docg3: flash@0 {
	...
	reg = <0x0 0x2000>;
	...
};

Thanks,
Mark.
