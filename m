Looks like it's broken with gcc 4.7 too, so it might be that it's never
worked. The problem seems to be that offsettable addresses are assumed by
GCC to have a 12-bit immediate range, which isn't true for half- and double-
work accessors, so GAS barfs when presented with the final (invalid) code.

Since we don't have double-word I/O accessors, we can just fallback to "Q"
for the half-word case:

 }


but this has the downside of *always* generating the target address into a
register and then using the basic [rN] addressing mode. A simple example
being smsc911x_rx_readfifo, where we see:

  c021bbe4:       e1d230b2        ldrh    r3, [r2, #2]

changed into:

  c021bd50:       e2820002        add     r0, r2, #2
  c021bd54:       e1d030b0        ldrh    r3, [r0]

which sucks, frankly. Unfortunately, GCC doesn't give us another constraint
that we can use for this, so I think we just have to grin and bear it.
