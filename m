Nothing new from my side. This series of patches should have taken into account
all the comments I'd received from previous series. At least, I hope so.
If I forgot some points or if something is still missing, let me know and I'll
update the series accordingly.

I also wait for a kind of agreement on how we could update the framework API
so that more QSPI memories could be supported. I have already written a driver
for an Atmel QSPI controller. This driver is based on this series of patches.
I have to know what the updated API will be before sending another series for
the QSPI controller driver. So this series is one proposal for some API updates
but other proposals may exist.

I've asked Brian on IRC for review and pieces of advice on how he thinks the
work should be done. I've understood he's right now a little bit busy. I'm fine
with it. I also often have to deal with many topics almost in the same time so
I can understand whether he needs more time.

Anyway, I guess Brian has already started to review these patches since last
Friday he referred to a previous talk we had about some leading space:
