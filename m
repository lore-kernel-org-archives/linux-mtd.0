Exactly!! flash/mtd has nvmem provider which should be represented in 
the DT.

There is no change in DT side from your original patch vs the new 
approach. You still are going to have the same subnode.

Isn't it?

AFAIU, the new approach will make it explicit that there is a nvmem 
provider in the DT.

If you think the sub node is going to be a problem from MTD point of 
view then that is worth discussing.
Adding subnode in nvmem bindings is not going to help or make the 
situation any better.

Lets see how this goes!
