I wouldn't say it's a mistake necessarily. The old compatible would
probably work to some extent. I'd assume it was tested to some level.
Or it could be other changes exposing a difference.

Yes, I know. That's exactly when you should have multiple compatibles.
Trying to guarantee things are the same is just going to get you in
trouble. You only need to figure out if blocks are obviously different
and only drop the old compatible in that case.

Yes, but you don't want to have to update every single driver.
