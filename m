That would be ideal, but unfortunately the main users of filesystem encryption
are using old kernel versions which don't have fs/crypto/, usually 4.4 at
latest.  So it would be nice for it to be easier to backport the "use different
bytes from the encrypted filename" change to 4.4-stable, as I've been doing for
some of the other filesystem encryption fixes.  And people do need it, it seems,
as it causes real problems like undeletable files; Gwendal is even already
trying to merge a fix into some Chrome OS kernel.

I think the series through fscrypt makes more sense, though if I don't have it
ready soon please go ahead and take the f2fs portion through the f2fs tree.

Thanks!
