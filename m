Yes, that would be the ideal way. But the reality is that there is close
to zero chance of all the DaVinci platforms using AEMIF ever getting
converted to DT. This means that we will never be able to get rid of
this piece of code.

I do agree platform data is not the direction you want to take on ARM
but at the same time its not really a deprecated mechanism as far as the
broader kernel is concerned.

So, can we consider adding platform data mechanism to the AEMIF driver?

Thanks,
