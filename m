Indeed, I missed that point.

It really depends on what we want to do. I see at least two solutions
for this problem:
1/ keep the nand_dt_init() implementation as is and ask
   nand_scan_ident() callers to pre-set their default value in ecc.mode.
   This should work since ecc.mode is only overridden if ecc_mode is >= 0.
2/ modify the nand_dt_init function to assign the ecc_mode even if it
   is negative, or create a new value in the enum (NAND_ECC_UNSPECIFIED
   = -1) and assign it to ecc.mode when ecc_mode is negative.

1# does not require any change, but if we choose this solution, we
should make it clear that NAND controller drivers should set their
default value before calling nand_scan_ident().
And if go for 2#, that's not like we'll have to patch a lot of
drivers (AFAICT, the only user in 4.2 is the brcmnand driver) ;-).

Best Regards,

Boris
