Won't this problem just go away as soon as we get the mxs converted to the
generic pinmux subsystem that Linus Walleij is doing?

Obviously, you would not have to check the soc type really, you would have
to instead check for different versions of the gpmi, which you most likely
have to anyway because reusing the same hardware block in a new chip usually
comes with other changes as well. 

Note how the driver already does this with code like

+	if (GPMI_IS_MX23(this) || GPMI_IS_MX28(this))
+		nfc = &gpmi_nfc_hal_mxs;

If you really want to call out obsceneties, how about the fact that this
driver comes with an 805 line patch to add a HAL for a single chip!

Such abstractions should not be introduced as long as there is only
a single instance of the hardware.

That would certainly work until we have the pinmux subsystem to
take care of it.
