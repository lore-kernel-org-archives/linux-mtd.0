You know what? I'll go get some sleep, coffee doesn't cut it anymore :)

Yep, that's all right, sorry for the confusion.

Maybe change this to "setting the number of dummy cycles not supported by chip, 
ignoring" or something, to be explicit about the fallback and that this is not
supported by the chip. But this is just an idea, feel free to ignore it.

Yup.
