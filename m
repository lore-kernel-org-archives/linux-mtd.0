I don't get it. What was the problem with my initial suggestion (the
denali specific one, not the generic approach)? You proposed to make it
generic, which, I agree, is a bit more complicated.

Okay, one more theoretical case I'd like to expose: you have board
design with different NAND parts which have different ECC requirements.
If you were about to describe the exact ECC strength you want for each
board you'll have to have different DTs. Maximizing the ECC strength
would still work, but what if the MTD user needs some OOB bytes (like
is the case with JFFS2) and ECC maximization reserved all of the
available bytes?

The other reason I prefer to have the drivers automatically guessing
what's appropriate is because then you don't have to care when writing
your DT.

If the bootloader implements the same logic it should match.

Really, I don't see what's the problem with the function I proposed,
but I'm willing to make a concession.
Make the nand-ecc-strength+nand-ecc-step-size or nand-ecc-maximize
mandatory so that if someone ever needs to support the 'match NAND
requirements' feature we won't have to add a vendor specific property
like this one [1].

Are you fine with that?
