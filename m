Right, there would be no benefit in using the kernel command line,
it just moves the information to another place inside of the same DT
(the /chosen property).

I think you can normally rely on the first block being readable
on flash, in particular if you write it very rarely (when updating
the partition information), so it would be technically possible to
have a partition table in there, but in practice that's not how
things are done, so the argument is useless.

Right. I think either way can work, and I see advantages in both.
The downside of relying just on the name is that mounting the rootfs
by GUID doesn't work until you specify another command line, which
is a bit annoying but not a huge problem.
