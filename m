Yes, it's old and new compatible strings in this case and it's newest
compatible string first.

I guess we should say "newest compatible for IP first" instead. There
are some exceptions where we add fallbacks later on, but that falls
under the most-specific part.

It's order that the bindings are defined, not Linux support really,
but in practice those are the same.
