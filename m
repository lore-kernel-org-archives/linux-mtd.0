This series consolidates the various cut'n'pasted Posix ACL implementations
into a single common one based on the ->get_acl method Linus added a while
ago and a new ->set_acl counterpart.

This remove ~1800 lines of code and provides a single place to implement
various nasty little gems of the semantics.

Unfortunately the 9p code is still left out - it implements the ACLs
in two very weird ways, one using the common code but on the client only,
and one pasing things straight through to the server.  We could easily
convert it to the new code on the write side if ->set_acl took a dentry,
but there's no cance to do that on the ->get_acl side.  Ideas how to
handle it welcome.

After that we'd be ready to never go into the fs for the ACL attributes
and branch straight to the ACL code below the syscall, repairing the
old API braindamage of overloading ACLs onto the xattrs.


Changes from V1:
 - check for symlinks in the ACL code and remove checks in the lower
   level functions.
 - remove get_acl instances for symlinks in a few filesystems
 - pass a umode_t mode argument to posix_acl_chmod to accomodate f2fs
 - various cosemtic bits from the reviews.

Note that I still haven't heard from ocfs2 folks, so the patch is left
unchanged.
