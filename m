Thanks for the explanation.

If we do not write the OOB, should we write the ECC bytes?
The hooks should comment clearly about how to implement them :(

the nandbiterr test mode does the test as above.
But i think the multi-writes to the same page should occur only for the
SLC nand. 

I will read your new patch set carefully in this weekend.
