Hi Jens,
in my RAID tests bfq performed as well as in non-RAID tests.  Probably
you refer to the fact that, in a RAID configuration, IOPS can become
very high.  But, if that is the case, then the response to your
objections already emerged in the previous thread.  Let me sum it up
again.

I tested bfq on virtually every device in the range from few hundred
of IOPS to 50-100KIOPS.  Then, through the public script I already
mentioned, I found the maximum number of IOPS that bfq can handle:
about 400K with a commodity CPU.

In particular, in all my tests with real hardware, bfq
- is not even comparable to that of any of the other scheduler, in
  terms of responsiveness, latency for real-time applications, ability
  to provide strong bandwidth guarantees, ability to boost throughput
  while guaranteeing bandwidths;
- is a little worse than the other scheduler for only one test, on
  only some hardware: total throughput with random reads, were it may
  lose up to 10-15% of throughput.  Of course, the scheduler that reach
  a higher throughput leave the machine unusable during the test.

So I really cannot see a reason why bfq could do worse than any of
these other schedulers for some single-queue device (conservatively)
below 300KIOPS.

Finally, since, AFAICT, single-queue devices doing 400+ KIOPS are
probably less than 1% of all the single-queue storage around (USB
drives, HDDs, eMMC, standard SSDs, ...), by sticking to mq-deadline we
are sacrificing 99% of the hardware, to help 1% of the hardware, for
one kind of test cases.

I don't think bfq can be considered a scheduler for only desktops any
longer.

Thanks,
Paolo
