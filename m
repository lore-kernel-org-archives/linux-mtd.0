Yes

Absolutely.


Even when it's not needed, please keep this habit of using more
parenthesis than required by precedence to make code clearer.

Moreover, it's not like if the driver would come without previous code.
So, this re-factoring comes with the experience of previous driver and
its aim is to be comparable feature-wise with the old one. So the amount
of changes doesn't surprise me.

As Boris noted in his patch series, additional optimization and use of
common BCH code can be studied afterwards.
