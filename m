Well, I personally have the patch set but haven't had a chance to review
it. Can you resend with MTD in the CC, since we haven't had any comments
anyway? I believe MTD people are much less likely to look at it if you
forget the CC :)

You can just title it [PATCH RESEND v4 X/Y], possibly with a LKML
link back to the original v4, if you want to help avoid confusion.
