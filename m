Yes, it does the automatic update of the status registers for every 
read/writes do report any ECC errors.

I had gone through it, here in driver i saw something like 
"nand_scan_ident" calls which still use the RAW commands.

So i need to do most of the custom nand scan implementation which i am 
doing it right now in my code!!!

I don't see great advantage of re-writing these call backs in my driver 
( Which are very well written and tested ). Also the DMA handling is bit 
different than what i had seen in the denali.c code.
In my case most of the limitation comes from the controller.

We have used nand base kind of implementation wherever is possible.
eg: We have leveraged the code from nand base to detect the nand device 
properties.
