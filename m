I don't think this patch will help.

I have seen the same crash on a 2.6.36 system with all of the UbiFs/Ubi
backported.  It is also an IMX25 based system.

We have,

 Code: e4863004 e5953004 e1560003 0a00002a (e593200c)

I run this,

   $ printf "\x04\x30\x86\xe4"
            "\x04\x30\x95\xe5" 
            "\x03\x00\x56\xe1"

   $ objdump --disassemble-all -b binary -m arm crash.dump 
   crash.dump:     file format binary


   Disassembly of section .data:

   00000000 <.data>:
      0:   e4863004        str     r3, [r6], #4

      8:   e1560003        cmp     r6, r3

     10:   e593200c        ldr     r2, [r3, #12]

The values 'r6' and 'r5' are pointers and they are far from non-NULL and
look like good kernel data pointers.  Something in the list is 'NULL'.
There is a load of 'r3' as NULL and then the use of '[r3, #12]' which
gives the crash address of '0xc'.

Here is the objdump with source interspersed for my build,

        sem->activity = 0;
 350:   e3a0a000        mov     sl, #0
 354:   e1a05000        mov     r5, r0

        if (waiter->flags & RWSEM_WAITING_FOR_WRITE) {
 368:   e593200c        ldr     r2, [r3, #12]

The compiler picks different registers,

  r3/sl+r3, r5/r0, r6/r5 but the code is the same.

The 'rw_semaphore' is 

    struct rw_semaphore {
            __s32		activity;
            struct list_head	wait_list;
    };

So, the 'wait_list' is non-NULL, the rw_semaphore is non-NULL, but
'wait_list->next' is NULL.  This seems to be very consistent with this
'oops'.

It seems that the "ltree_lock" doesn't protect the use of the
ltree_lookup() versus insertions and deletions?  Ie, ltree_lookup() may
return non-NULL, but an interrupt/pagefault before a 'le->users +/- =
1;' may mean the node is released?  On a UP system, does 'spin_lock()'
actually do anything?  The rw_semaphore uses spin_lock_irqsave().
However, that doesn't make sense as I think this occurs mainly on a
ARM926 system.

The ARM926 systems do not have proper 'lock free' idioms like
'ldrex/strex' and they try to do atomic operations by locking
interrupts.  I think that UbiFs/UBI maybe called on a 'data fault' or
'program fault' (in user space) when memory pressure is present.  I have
seen this occur in some sound drivers where the data source is coming
from disk (or maybe the driver uses vmalloc() or something).  So I think
on occasion, the ltree_lookup() may not work or there is something weird
with the atomic primatives and data/page faults.

Fwiw,
Bill Pringlemeir.
