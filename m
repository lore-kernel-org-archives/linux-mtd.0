Also, in case you weren't aware of this already, I should mention that with ext4
we have a way to do a full xfstests run with encryption enabled, to find bugs
that wouldn't be found in dedicated tests.  Basically you run xfstests with the
"test_dummy_encryption" mount option (or with the "ext4/encrypt" config for
xfstests-bld), and it makes ext4 encrypt all new files and directories without
userspace having to set up encryption policies.  It may be useful to look into
implementing this for ubifs and/or f2fs too.

(I'd actually like to get rid of test_dummy_encryption and just use the ioctls,
but currently it's not really possible because it would require some ugly hooks
in xfstests, and also the root directory cannot be encrypted because e2fsck
requires that lost+found exist and be unencrypted.  An "inherit-only" encryption
policy settable by a mkfs flag is also an option, but it seems like overkill
just for testing.  So I think we'll be stuck with test_dummy_encryption for a
while longer.  At least I've written kernel and xfstests-bld patches that make
it a little less ugly kernel-side...)

Eric
