Im not sure my selfe but as this would need to be robust for a single read try
to be reliable I did not see the point in using a pool loop of 1 microsecond
on x86 I tried this and timeout_us of 1 will resulted in a single
read in more than 10% on the idle system and in almost 100% doing
a single read on loaded systems. So if the poll loop was introduced with
the assumption that just reading once imediately could miss the ritical
event with resonable probability then timeout_us==1 does not change that.

I included you as your it showed up with:

that is right - but the assumption of poll_timeout is that the
timeout case would actually be rare and if you look at the actual
timings that one has of poll_timout routines (that are based on
usleep_range()) on loaded systems they overrun by 100s of microseconds
very frequnently. 

But you are right that in the 50us case this is not ideal - the 
focus I had was on the very long timeouts that in some cases were set
to up to 5 seconds with tight-loops (or close to timght-loops)

The problem really is that on idle ssytems the sleep_us argument
works ok and the overruns are not that dramatic - but on loaded
systems the sleep_us routlinely overruns significantly

so really small sleep_us make no sense I think - setting it to 0
tight-loop might be justified for small timeout_us (say 10us)
but long busy-wait loops are bad (and probably technically not
that sensible ither). If a busy-wait loop does not get the data/state
it wants within a few loops then busy-waiting is nonsentical and
that is why the intent of the exponential back-off solution does
a few tight-loops and then switches to sleeping delays.

It might be necessary to set it to a more fine grain stepping than
the brute-force *2 - but the principle I think would be better
than what is being done now.

and thanks for your comments !

thx!
