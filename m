Okay, I had a closer look at both implementations, and indeed Faraday's
implementation was trying to convert different NAND operations into
their associated 'faraday' program flow (referenced by program
address), which not only complicates the implementation, but also
implies adapting the ->cmdfunc() logic each time a new feature is added
to the core.
In the other hand, your driver, while exposing an higher level
interface, lacks all the detection logic that is part of the code
(actually I haven't looked to deeply in the code, but even if the
detection logic is here, this means you're more or less duplicating the
nand_base.c code).

So, my suggestion is to still use the NAND framework, but try to be
smarter to avoid bloating the ->cmdfunc() implementation. Here is a
draft showing the direction (it's not been tested at all, and should
serve a reference rather than a real implementation).
Of course this implementation is not perfect, but it should still
provide basic support for your NAND controller until we come with a
NAND framework v2 allowing for more optimizations at the NAND level.

Don't hesitate to ask questions or point problems in my approach.

Best Regards,

Boris
