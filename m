From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

For v2 encryption policies, we need to hash the master key to compute a
master_key_identifier.  Naively, we could just use a truncated SHA-512
or another common cryptographic hash function.  However, that would
cause the same key material to be used in two different ways: both as
input to the hash function, and as input to the AES-ECB-based KDF when
deriving the per-inode encryption keys.  There *probably* isn't any
practical attack on that, but still it would be better "crypto hygiene"
to use the key material for one purpose only, e.g. just for a KDF.

It also happens that the AES-based KDF is on our list of things to fix.
While it does generate unique derived keys with sufficient entropy, it
is nonstandard and has some problems that don't exist in standard KDFs
such as HKDF.  For example, the AES-based KDF is reversible: given a
derived key and nonce, an attacker can easily compute the master key.
This was maybe okay for the original threat model of ext4 encryption
where the master key and derived keys were considered equally hard to
compromise.  But now we would like to be more robust against threats
such as a derived key being compromised through a timing attack, or a
derived key for an in-use file being compromised after the master key
has already been wiped from memory via FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY.

HKDF also has other advantages over the AES-ECB-based KDF such as evenly
distributing the entropy from the input key material and being more
extensible to deriving other key material that may be needed.

Since we're introducing a new encryption policy version that already
includes an on-disk format change, and we also now have a good place to
cache an HMAC transform for each master key (struct fscrypt_master_key)
so that HKDF can be implemented efficiently, we finally have a chance to
switch to HKDF to derive the per-file keys.

In addition, we'll use HKDF to derive the master_key_identifier,
avoiding the need for a separate cryptographic hash primitive.  This is
secure because the output from HKDF is cryptographically isolated, i.e.
sending some output in the clear doesn't reveal any other output, in a
computational sense.  (This is assuming that application-specific info
strings aren't repeated between different uses of HKDF, but we'll use
context bytes to ensure that.)

Thus, this patch adds an implementation of HKDF to keyinfo.c, using an
HMAC transform allocated from the crypto API.  Later patches will make
use of it.

Note that using HKDF-SHA512 as the key derivation function will
introduce a dependency on the security and implementation of SHA-512,
whereas before we were using only AES for both key derivation and
encryption.  However, by using HMAC rather than the hash function
directly, HKDF is designed to remain secure even if various classes of
attacks, e.g. collision attacks, are found against the underlying
unkeyed hash function.  Even HMAC-MD5 is still considered secure in
practice, despite MD5 itself having been heavily compromised.  And
meanwhile, the AES-based KDF used the public nonce as the cipher *key*,
which is an unusual case which probably hasn't undergone much
cryptanalysis.  HKDF-SHA512 seems like a safer bet.

We *could* actually avoid introducing a hash primitive by instantiating
HKDF-Expand with CMAC-AES256 as the pseudorandom function rather than
HMAC-SHA512.  That would work; however, the HKDF specification doesn't
explicitly allow a non-HMAC pseudorandom function, so it would be less
standard.  It would also require skipping HKDF-Extract and making the
API accept only 32-byte master keys, since otherwise HKDF-Extract using
CMAC-AES would produce a pseudorandom key only 16 bytes long which would
only be enough for AES-128, not AES-256.

+ *
+ * HKDF-Extract can be skipped if the input is already a good pseudorandom key
+ * that is at least as long as the hash.  While the fscrypt master keys should

+ * short keys (e.g. AES-128-CBC) we'd like to permit the master key to be
+ * shorter than HKDF_HASHLEN bytes.  Thus, we still must do HKDF-Extract.
+ *
+ * Ideally, HKDF-Extract would be passed a random salt for each distinct input
+ * key.  Details about the advantages of a random salt can be found in the HKDF
+ * paper (Krawczyk, 2010; "Cryptographic Extraction and Key Derivation: The HKDF

+ * Logically, it's more likely that the keys would be passed to unsalted
