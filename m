We do not necessary  to track it.  For normal nand, I can compute it 
myself ,
just as the current driver does; for ONFI nand ,we should parse it out 
from the Parameter Page.
It need an extra patch to do this.

bad news.  I do not have such chip yet, If i have , i will test it, and 
change the current MTD code.

I do not use the SLC/MLC info now.

When i am free, I will change the current code. But i am a little busy 
now :(
