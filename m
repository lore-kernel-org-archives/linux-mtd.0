If the assumption is host endian, that's fine, just document it.

It looks like the code uses a little-endian accessor (readw) in a couple
places.  The instance in gpio_nand_readbuf16() should never be reached
since the NAND layer should never do an unaligned buffer read, but the one
in gpio_nand_verifybuf16() could cause problems.

The implementation in nand_base.c uses readw(), but at least it uses it
consistently between read_buf16(), write_buf16(), and verify_buf16().
readsw()/writesw() do not appear to do byte swapping, at least on powerpc,
while readw() does.

Even so, the generic implementation could read data that is byte-reversed
from what another implementation wrote, or vice versa.  I wonder if there
are any big-endian platforms with 16-bit NAND that use the generic buffer
functions -- doesn't look like it from a quick glance.

OK, though if you think this will be common enough to include in the
generic binding, is it only going to appear on ARM chips?

What about using a "gpio-nand-io-sync" property instead of assuming that if
there's a second reg resource, it must be this?

That doesn't sound ideal.

I think on that platform you should not specify gpio-control-nand in the
compatible.  Have the driver or platform code match on a specific
compatible, and then do whatever is appropriate internally to Linux to make
it work.

Or perhaps the io sync address should just be a physical address, not a reg
that gets translated.
