Great!

Perfect. I've trimmed, and responded to a few things. Let me know if you
hvae more questions.

I don't think removing the secondary conditions above is a good idea; it
seems to provide some value as a backup, in case of (for example)
bitflips in the OOB. I was just commenting that it was a little strange,
and that it might be good to write up a comment based on our
understanding of this OOB header format. Either text, or some small
ASCII art. (Along the lines of "logical block number assigned to a
physical block is stored in OOB of the first page, in 3 16-bit copies
layed out as <foo>; in case of errors, we check that a 2 or more of
these copies agree. Reserved values <bar> mean <blah>.")

IOW, your job isn't just to prune down the vendor's code, but to make it
cleaner and clearer to the reader/reviewer.

Caveat: a simple test of one or a few device(s) is not exactly
verification that this wasn't useful at all, but given we can't figure
out a proper reason for it, removing it seems prudent.

Yes, I suppose that is a fine pattern. You can't really do anything
about high numbers of bitflilps, unless you really want to add in write
support (in which case you could probably try to copy/migrate the table
to an available block).

My point wasn't really just for well-handled devices, or even Sharp
devices at all. What if this partition parser ends up in the parser list
for some other random device? e.g., when we add better device tree
support for other parsers, it'll start becoming easier for arbitrary
platforms to utilize arbitrary parsers; I wouldn't expect people to want
to use this parser, but if we have a quick way to say "this doesn't
match, skip me", then that would be helpful.

Or maybe another case: what if someone utilizes some completely
different partition layout (and gets their bootloader to handle it) but
is still otherwise using the same kernel/platform support? We don't want
to waste too much time scanning for this partition table if possible.

That doesn't seem to have much more that can help us. Maybe your current
version is the best we can do.
