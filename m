Okay, thanks.

Julia proposed to generate this script using sgen, so I guess this will
come later through a different tree.

Yep, I think I'll resend the series and split the modification so that
you can pick changes independently (as you suggested a few days ago).

Anyway, reviews from other people would be much appreciated. As I said,
most of changes have been automated with coccinelle, but some of them
have been made manually done, and this is the case for all drivers using
the following pattern:

var = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info) +
	      sizeof(struct nand_chip) + ... ,...);

because I failed to find a pattern common enough to match the cases I
had, and manually fixing them was easier for me...

Sure.
