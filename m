Subject: [PATCH] block: BFQ default for single queue devices

This sets BFQ as the default scheduler for single queue
block devices (nr_hw_queues == 1) if it is available. This
affects notably MMC/SD-cards but notably also UBI and
the loopback device.

I have been running it for a while without any negative
effects on my pet systems and I want some wider testing
so let's throw it out there and see what people say.
Admittedly my use cases are limited.

I talked to Pavel a bit back and it turns out he has a
usecase for BFQ as well and I bet he also would like it
as default scheduler for that system (Pavel tell us more,
I don't remember what it was!)

Intuitively I could understand that maybe we want to
leave the loop device (possibly others? nbd? rbd?) as
"none", as it is probably relying on a scheduler on the
device below it, so I'm open to passing in a scheduler hint
from the respective subsystem in say struct blk_mq_tag_set.
However that makes for a bit of syntactic dissonance
with the struct member ".nr_hw_queues" (I wonder how
the loop device can have 1 "hardware queue"?) so
maybe we should in that case also rename that struct
member to ".nr_queues" fair and square before we start
making adjustments for treating queues differently whether
they are in hardware or actually not.
