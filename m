This driver was specifically refused by the SPI subsystem maintainer:

  http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2015-03/msg00422.html

He suggested the MFD subsystem, where it was also refused:

  http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1504.0/03162.html

Andy Shevchenko suggested drivers/misc, so I mailed Arnd Bergmann and asked
if he would accept it there.

Arnd took a good look at the driver and suggested the MTD/NAND subsystem.
This is after all a driver for a NAND chip controller. The controller just
happens to reside in a CPLD with custom firmware, which is controlled via
SPI and has some GPIO controller functionality thrown in.

I realize it's an odd hardware setup, and I can't fix that, but this really
does seem to be the best place for it.

I can deal with your other comments on the patch, but I'd really like some
agreement on where this driver will be accepted first. I've come full circle
with getting referred back to the SPI subsystem.
