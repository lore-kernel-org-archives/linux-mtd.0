Sure.  I'll get on to that now.

Only once a binding has became ABI.  As there are no users of this
driver yet (this will change after this sync'ing patch-set has been
applied), so we can safely consider this binding to be in-progress and
as such, not yet ABI, thus we can do this ol' switch-aroo without the
usual 6 month deprecation period.
