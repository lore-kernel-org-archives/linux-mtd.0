Just some background for people who may be unfamiliar with what's going on here
(and it may be useful to include some of this in the patch description):

When accessing files without access to the key, userspace needs to operate on a
filename derived from the ciphertext filename, which contains arbitrary bytes. 

But since it's supported to use filenames up to FILENAME_MAX (255 bytes) in
length when using encryption, we can't always base-64 encode the filename, since
that may make it too long.

The way this is solved currently is that for filenames with ciphertext length
greater than 32 bytes, the filesystem provides an 8-byte "cookie" (split into
'hash' and 'minor_hash'), which along with the last 16 bytes of the filename
ciphertext is base-64 encoded into a fixed-length name.  The filesystem returns
this on readdir.  Then, when a lookup is done, the filesystem translates this
info back into a specific directory entry.

Since ext4 directory entries do not contain a hash field, ext4 relies only on
the 16 bytes of ciphertext to distinguish collisions within a directory block.
Unfortunately, this is broken because with the encryption mode used for
filenames (CTS), the ciphertext of the last 16-byte block depends only on the
plaintext up to and including the *second to last* block, not up to the last
block.  This causes long filenames that differ just near the end to collide.

We could fix this by using the second to last block of ciphertext rather than
the last one.  However, using the last *two* blocks as you're proposing should
be fine too.

Of course we could also hash the filename's ciphertext with SHA-256 or
something, but it's nice to take advantage of the encryption mode, and not have
to do yet another hash.

I am not too worried about changing the way encrypted filenames are presented,
since applications are not supposed to rely on this.  (Though we probably should
be doing something to catch broken applications, like encoding the filenames
slightly differently after each reboot...)

Strangely, f2fs and ubifs do not use the bytes from the filename at all when
trying to find a specific directory entry in this case.  So this patch doesn't
really affect them.  This seems unreliable; perhaps we should introduce a
function like "fscrypt_name_matches()" which all the filesystems could call?
Can any of the f2fs and ubifs developers explain why they don't look at any
bytes from the filename?

Anyway, a couple nits on this patch:

Use 'sizeof(buf)'

de->name_len < 32

(or replace 32 with FS_FNAME_CRYPTO_DIGEST_SIZE, here and below)
