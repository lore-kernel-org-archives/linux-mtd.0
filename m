If not too much to ask, this is the test that I believe is needed.
You seem to have a setup ready, hence why I'm asking you, if
possible, to give it a shot.

(1) Scrub the BBT from the NAND. Or scrub the whole NAND.
You cannot do this from the kernel, it needs to be done from the bootloader=
.

(2) Mark a couple blocks as bad using the OOB -- AFAICR, there
was a command to do this in the bootloader.

(3) Boot, let Linux create the BBT and see if it catches the bad blocks.

This would guarantee that devices with factory bad blocks,
(and no BBT), would be OK with this patch.
