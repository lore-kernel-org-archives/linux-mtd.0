Someone has used a version of the driver on the PowerPC.  I don't have
access to his email address now.  Anyways, the chipselect code is
different on the PowerPC versions of the controller afair.  So if some
external code sets up the chipselect for a single chip, then things are
fine.

Both the PowerPC and ARM support DT/OF, but you can never actually run
either version as the code must be compiled for either assembler.  So I
am not quite sure that this was the correct way to go anyways...  So I
agree with your conclusion we can remove that binding.

Bill.
