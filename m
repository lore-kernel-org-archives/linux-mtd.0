Okay, got it. I guess we should just expose the chip select in a linear
way (3 banks of 4 CS means the controller should support up to 12
chips), unless you really have a way to change the CS pins routing
internally.

Yes, let's drop the property for now. Just trying to understand how the
IP works ;).

You mean reducing the timings because the board design prevents using
the highest supported mode for example? That would actually be a valid
use case, and I guess we could make a generic property for that
(without the vendor prefix).
