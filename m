Ah.. that is an excellent point, and leads me to realise that using
compatible in this way is wrong.  The whole point of compatible is
that the node is, well, compatible with *all* the things in the list,
and therefore the things in the list are compatible with each other.

Using it for a list of entirely different things to attempt in order
is not correct.
