That also reminds me of the old vs new PATA/IDE drivers a long time ago.
A number of us would stay on the old ones because we were satisfied,
never really making the effort to migrate until it we were really forced.

For the NAND, I think that if the old driver had to coexist with the new
one, at the very least the config option name must change so that it's
not selected by default by make oldconfig, and it's clearly written that
it is not maintained anymore, may be broken and that any one having a
good reason to use it must absolutely contact the maintainer to get the
other one fixed.

Just my two cents,
Willy
