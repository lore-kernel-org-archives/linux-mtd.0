I always felt that we should eventually move the eeprom drivers out of
drivers/misc into their own subsystem. Moving them under drivers/mtd
also seems reasonable.

Having a common API sounds like a good idea, and we should probably
spend some time comparing the options.

My first thought is that it should be more generic than that and not
have the mac address hardcoded as the purpose. We could possibly use
regmap as the in-kernel interface, and come up with a more generic
way of referring to registers in another device node.
