Well, your series originally defined this stub function before I
recommended a change to drop the CONFIG_OF check. See your v2 patch:

  http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2013-August/047863.html

So there never was a build breakage until David rebased; the patch was
just a dependent part of the series that should never have been
postponed.
