I think I've written about this multiple times now, but for me it
really just boils down to sane default, and policy in the kernel.
BFQ is very complicated, about 10K lines of code. I'm not comfortable
making that the default right now - as I've mentioned in other
replies, I think something like that should be driven by the distros
as they will ultimately be the ones that usually get complaints
about behavioral changes that impact performance adversely. This isn't
just about running some benchmarks and calling it a day.

Maybe some day we can make it the default on mq for single queue
devices, but I just don't think we are there yet in terms of
coverage. 

While I don't work for a distro anymore, I do have my hands dirty
with a fairly substantial deployment at work. There we run mq-deadline
on single queue devices, and kyber on multiqueue capable devices.
