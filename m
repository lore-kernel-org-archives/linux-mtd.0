Let me basically repeat Mark's answer here, with my words.

Unfortunately, facts mismatch with your optimistic view: after so many
years and concordant test results, only very few distributions
switched to bfq, no major distribution did (AFAIK).  As I already
wrote, the reason is the one pointed out by Torvalds [1].  Do you want
a simple example?  Take the last sentence in Jan's email in this
thread: "I *personally would* consider bfq a safer default ...  but *I
don't feel too strongly* about it." And he is definitely a storage
expert.

The problem, in particular, is that bfq is a complex beast, fighting
against a jungle of I/O issues.  You have to be really into bfq, even
to just know all of its features!

reference point.
>=20

Same situation for embedded devices, if not even worse.  Again for the
same reasons above.  In the end, it is hard even for a kernel expert
to be an in-depth expert of every possible complex component.

To not answer too seriously here, let me answer with a quote that is
still missing a clear paternity: "Everything should be made as simple
as possible, but not simpler." :)

Thanks,
