It's easy to see that both mq-deadline and BFQ define a queue-wide lock. 
For mq-deadline its deadline_data.lock. For BFQ it's bfq_data.lock. That 
last lock serializes all bfq_dispatch_request() calls and hence reduces 
concurrency while processing I/O requests. From bfq_dispatch_request():

static struct request *bfq_dispatch_request(struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctx)
{
	struct bfq_data *bfqd = hctx->queue->elevator->elevator_data;
	[ ... ]
	spin_lock_irq(&bfqd->lock);
	[ ... ]
}

I think the above makes it very clear that bfqd->lock is queue-wide.

It is easy to understand why both I/O schedulers need a queue-wide lock: 
the only way to avoid race conditions when considering all pending I/O 
requests for scheduling decisions is to use a lock that covers all 
pending requests and hence that is queue-wide.

Bart.
