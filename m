Are you sure?  I just tried rebasing my ubifs support patches for xfstests and
xfstests-bld onto the latest xfstests and xfstests-bld respectively, then
building a new kvm-xfstests appliance and the latest kernel from Linus's tree.
These are the failures I see with ubifs in the "encrypt" group:

$ kvm-xfstests -c ubifs -g encrypt

generic/397 is failing (I don't know why), and generic/398 is failing.  But
generic/419 is *not* failing.

What's happening with generic/398 is that it's trying cross-rename to exchange
an unencrypted file with an encrypted one.  The tests expects ENOKEY, but there
are actually two separate reasons why this operation is expected to fail:

(1) It's trying to link a file into an encrypted directory with the directory's
    key being available (ENOKEY)
(2) It's trying to place an unencrypted file into an encrypted directory, which
    violates the policy that all files in an encrypted directory have the same
    encryption policy (EPERM)

Personally I think that maybe the generic/398 test should just be updated to
accept either error code, given that there are two valid reasons for the
operation to fail.
