Not exactly,  spi-tx-nbit = <4> suggests that SPI device will use QUAD
writes, not support QUAD writes. There is no need to set what mode
slave supports, user just set the certain mode slave will work in.

Actually, spi-3wire can be regarded as a part of spi-single, but
corrected as what you said, there will be some inconvenient.
1,the driver that has already used spi-3wire need a big change.
2,there have to be a complexed check in spi framework if set like:
 spi-quad = <tx-only | rx-only | duplex>
 spi-dual = <tx-only | rx-only | duplex>
 spi-single = <tx-only | rx-only | full-duplex | half-duplex>
