I completely agree with all of the above, but I'm still a bit uncertain
about how useful implementing #1 would be.

As you say, encoding the specific (per-driver) ECC information in the
devicetree seems the safest way of dealing with that.

On the other side, I fail to clearly see a valid use case for reporting
the "minimum" ECC required strength in the devicetree.

If I'm not missing anything, then I'd say just implement #2, for each driver
that needs it. I know that pxa3xx-nand should have it to avoid future issues.
This item is on top of my NAND TODO list.

Thanks for following the discussion!
