OK.

If you don't understand your own code, how can I be expected to maintain
it? This one's pretty trivial and harmless, but an accumulation of
answers like this don't exactly put me in a good mood.

FWIW, I expect the comment has nothing to do with the __VA_ARGS__; it's
just commenting that he has placed a macro around the array just in case
somebody needs/wants to rearrange formats later. That way, we don't
necessarily have to rewrite the whole table, but can just change the
macros.

So the __VA_ARGS__ is just there to make the compiler happy (it thinks
an array argument to a macro actually looks like more than one
argument), and the comment is only mildly descriptive of its purpose.
