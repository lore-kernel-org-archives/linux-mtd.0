No, let's not create unnecessary churn because of a minor mistake. So,
yes we *should* have used brcm,<soc>-nand in the first place, but now
that there are DTSes out there using "brcm,nand-<soc>" there is not
really any point in doing this, so please update your patches so they
match the existing convention.
