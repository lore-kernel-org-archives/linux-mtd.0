This sort of information is often stored in places like flash partitions
too.  Are we sure that regmap is a good place to be hooking in here?
The use case is sane, and being able to use regmap to do some of it
seems sensible (I've seen people use OTP in PMICs for similar purposes)
but perhaps an additional layer of abstraction on top makes sense.

If this stuff is being represented in MTD doesn't MTD already have
adequate abstractions for saying "this region in flash".  But otherwise
this seems fine, it's not a generic regmap DT binding but instead rather
more specific than that.
