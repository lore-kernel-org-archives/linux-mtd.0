This process sounds very much like something that is needed for other
controllers: a way to match controller capabilties with the opcodes
supported by the flash. But it still isn't quite flexible enough for
others, because it doesn't try to abstract the selection criteria -- it
just uses lists that you presorted, with exceptions for a few different
types of devices (I'm referring to a later patch now, I guess, since
this patch actually has no users for stfsm_search_seq_rw_configs() yet).

This becomes an infinite loop if you can't find a matching config. You
probably meant 'config->cmd != 0':

	for (config = cfgs; config->cmd != 0; config++)

"pads" means "pins" here, right?

What does this represent? As far as I can see, all the configurations
you provide so far have this entry as 0x00.

What are MODE cycles? (Sorry if these are dumb questions.)

Several pieces of this sequence struct seems suspiciously similar to
what would be needed by several other controllers, while the remaining
pieces don't seem to be so special that they cannot be configured
beneath a SPI NOR framework. I'm becoming less convinced that your
controller/driver is as unique as you say it is.
