Exactly the kind of tweaking I'd like to avoid. If the NAND is not ONFI,
the vendor driver (nand_<manufacturer>.c) can overwrite
chip->default_onfi_timing_mode, and if the ONFI timings modes are not
exactly matching the NAND spec and you need the exact timings, then we
should consider adding a manufacturer hook to let the manufacturer
driver tweak the timings. In any case, I'm not willing to accept
timings description in the DT.

Boris
