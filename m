Exactly, I was talking about that snippet. I missed the fact that
ecc.strength is used to get bytes, and then re-calculated. Some comments
are definitely needed there.

Right, right.

I'd say you should require an ECC step size in your binding, instead of
assuming the 512-byte that gets set if the ecc.size is 0.

BTW, how does this patch deal with old devicetree files?
