Actually, this appears to be a flaw in our implementation of ChaCha20.
According to RFC7539:

   The inputs to ChaCha20 are:

   o  A 256-bit key

   o  A 32-bit initial counter.  This can be set to any number, but will
      usually be zero or one.  It makes sense to use one if we use the
      zero block for something else, such as generating a one-time
      authenticator key as part of an AEAD algorithm.

   o  A 96-bit nonce.  In some protocols, this is known as the
      Initialization Vector.

   o  An arbitrary-length plaintext

and so the initial value of the counter should be an internal
parameter of the implementation, not something that is exposed via the
IV input parameter.

Given how it is not uncommon for counters to be used as IV, this is a
fundamental flaw that could rear its head in other places as well, so
I propose we fix this one way (fix the current code) or the other
(deprecate the current code and create a new chacha20-rfc7539
blockcipher that uses a 96-bit IV and sets the counter to 0)
