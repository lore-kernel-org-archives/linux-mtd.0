Right, using platform_data sounds like a nice compromise solution.
I'm willing to accept this series with the current timing rework; and
leave the timing setup in-driver replacement for followup patches.

I think that's a bit of a different issue. This patch seems to be doing
two things: it removes the in-driver flash detection *and* reworks
timing setup.

How about we split this in two or even three patches? Along these lines:
1) introduce timing helpers, 2) rework timing setup, 3) remove in-driver
flash detection. Not sure how feasible it is.

Well, such move would include proper timing DT properties for non-ONFI
devices.
