This happens because we do NOT follow the right init procedure. The IC
guy told me.
If the BCH was not initialized correctly, it can not guarantees the
data is right.
This is why the mx28 failed.

For mx23, it should not reset the BCH, this is the right init
procedure for mx23.
But I did not ever boot 10000 times on mx23. I am not sure if it can
fail or not.

You can test it if you have time. :)

Happy new year.
