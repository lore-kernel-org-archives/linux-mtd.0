DT already offer all you need and nothing hinders you from
using mtdparts=.

I didn't recommend adding glibc+systemd in the initramfs. It can be very, very small
and trivial.
At least it would be much more clean than your pile of not so fancy MTD/UBI patches.

The initramfs can be part of the kernel image. No additional file needed.

Everything can be done with the existing framework. DT binding maybe be nice
for your use case but I fear it is not applicable.
