I'd suggest reviewing the proposal I posted so that you can influence
the design of this new API ;-).

Is the Read ID operation hardcoded or do you just use it as a way to
trigger predictable transfers on the IO bus?

I think this should be split in 2:

- the SPI NOR framework passing the operation to use to do the
  calibration (here a READ ID)
- the SPI controller framework replaying the same operation with
  different DLL configs until it finds the best match

So, it would basically be added as a new hook:

	int (*calibrate)(struct spi_mem *mem,
			 const struct spi_mem_op *tmpl);

and a new function provided by the spi-mem API

int spi_mem_calibrate(struct spi_mem *mem,
		      const struct spi_mem_op *tmpl);

and calibration outcome would be somehow attached to the spi_mem
object.

This way we stay memory agnostic but still provide the necessary blocks
at the spi-mem level to do such callibrations.

Would that work?
