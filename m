Two things:

1) By mistake, I put 'none' in the last command line above, but it =
should be mq-deadline:

sudo ./run_main_benchmarks.sh "throughput replayed-startup" "bfq =
mq-deadline"

2) If you are worried about wearing your device with writes, then just =
append 'raw' to the last command line. So:

sudo ./run_main_benchmarks.sh "throughput replayed-startup" "bfq =
mq-deadline" raw

'raw' means: "don't even create files for the background traffic, but =
just read raw sectors".

Thanks,
Paolo
