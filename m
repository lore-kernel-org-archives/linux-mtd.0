Yeah, I did notice this before my email. Here's an ugly hack (at end
of email) to test my theory about Problem 1. I didn't compile test it
(because I should go to bed now), but you get the idea. Can you give
this a shot? It should fix your specific case. Basically for all
overlays (I hope the function is only used for overlays) we assume all
nodes are NOT devices until they actually get added as a device. Don't
review the code, it's not meant to be :)
