Nope, if the NAND requires a different ECC block size, you will have
0xff in this field and the real ECC requirements will be exposed in the
extended parameter page [1].

->ecc_xxx_ds are encoding the minimum ECC requirements as expressed by
the NAND chip, so yes, it is an hint for the ECC engine configuration.

It does not necessarily means it has to be exactly the same, but it
should be used to determine which setting is appropriate. For example,
if the NAND says it requires a minimum of 4bits/512bytes but your
controller only supports 16bits/1024bytes, then it's fine.

It represents the minimum ECC requirements to ensure a 'reliable' setup.

nand_ecc_strength_good() is complaining if you choose an ECC setting
that is below the minimum requirements.

The choice is left to the ECC controller, but it should take the
->ecc_strength_ds and ->ecc_step_ds information into account when
choosing the ECC settings.

Yes, and that's not a problem.

We agree.

It is related to the chip requirements.
Say you have a chip that requires a minimum of 4bits/512bytes. If you
want to convert that to a 1024byte block setting it's perfectly fine,
but then you'll have to meet (2 * ->ecc_strength_ds) for the
ecc.strength parameter.

The nand-ecc-strength and nand-ecc-step DT properties are here to
override the chip requirements and force a specific setting. This is
for example needed when the bootloader hardcodes an ECC setting without
taking the NAND chip requirements into account, and since you want to
read/write from both the bootloader and linux, you'll have to force this
specific ECC setting, but this case should be the exception, not the
default behavior.

If you want an example on how to extrapolate ECC engine settings from
->ecc_xxx_ds info, you can look at the sunxi_nand driver [2].
