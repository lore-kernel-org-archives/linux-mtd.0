Sure. Really, it's just anything the controller driver needs to store on
a per-chip basis. All I'm suggesting is picking a name that doesn't
imply it's a per-controller instance, when it's actually a
per-flash-chip instance.

I never suggested just "_data"; I said "_drvdata".

That's interesting. Sounds like an OK idea. (Personally, I wouldn't
try to use mtd->priv for this, but otherwise looks OK.)

Hmm, OK. FWIW, they have both "driver data" and "controller state". It's
not perfectly clear to me why both exist.

Sure. I though a "driver data"-based name did this. But I'll leave it to
you. I could even be OK with "controller data", if you still think this
fits your overall controller refactoring plan, and communicates its
purpose best.
