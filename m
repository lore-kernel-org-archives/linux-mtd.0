I agree with Ezequiel's thoughts, since the excessive amount of noise
in this patch series has delayed it significantly. But at this point,
I think it has stabilized; we have reviews from the DT folks (thanks
guys; please comment if you have an official "ack" to give), and I
think we've retained backwards compatibility properly; I've combed
through it a few times over the months; we have a third-party tester;
and at this point, I'm sure we're all sick of this.

So, without further delay: pushed all patches except path 8 to l2-mtd.git.

Tony, you mentioned the DTS update in patch 8 going in via an ARM
tree? This patch is not urgent, and it should probably wait until we
know what release the rest of the series makes it into. This may
depend on David Woodhouse's recommendation, but I'm not sure this
series will have enough time baking in linux-next before entering
mainline in 3.13 (the merge window is approaching).

Pekon/Ezequiel/others: please feel free to send any follow up cleanups
for this driver. I'll take a look at what Ezequiel has already sent
out and see if it's still applicable on top.

Thanks,
Brian
