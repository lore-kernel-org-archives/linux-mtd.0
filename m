As Eric pointed out for steram ciphers such as chacha20 our policy
is to expose the raw IV in the base algorithm, and then layer
more restrictive implementations on top that can then be used
in different scenarios such as IPsec or disk encryption.

For example, with CTR, ctr(aes) is the base algorithm and places
no restrictions on the IV, while rfc3686(ctr(aes)) is the more
restrictive version that's used by IPsec.

Within the kernel I don't really see an issue with abuse because
all users are hopefully reviewed by the community.  If you're
worried about incorrect use in user-space we could think about
restricting access to these base implementations.

For chacha20 we did not add a restrictive template because the
primary user IPsec uses it only through AEAD where the IV restriction
is in place.

Cheers,
