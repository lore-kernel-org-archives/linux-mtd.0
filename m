Actually I meant

static inline struct nfc_info *get_nfc(struct nand_chip *chip) ...

The goal here is to retrieve the controller attached to a given chip in
order to avoid the global nfc_info variable (and abusing
nand_get/set_controller_data() to store a pointer to the controller is
not a good idea either: it's supposed to be used to store per-chip
private data).

Then, let's say I really care about this clear separation between NAND
controllers and NAND chips (even if the controller is only supporting a
single device), because it makes things clearer, and because it brings
some consistency in the NAND controller drivers.
That's something I've asked to other contributors, and I'm asking it to
you too.

You'll see that implementing this separation is not much more
complicated than having this global variable, and I must admit global
variable make me scream (especially when they can be avoided).

There's another reason actually. We have chip specific functions (like
->setup_read_retry()) which might want to use
non-standard/vendor-specific operations, and this implies patching all
->cmdfunc() implementations, or at least making sure they will work
fine with these new commands.
The ->cmd_ctrl() + generic nand_command_lp() for ->cmdfunc() is making
that a lot easier.

So yes, I'm clearly trying to avoid specific ->cmdfunc() (especially
when they are not generic enough to support new commands).

Again, ->cmd_ctrl() does not have to be used in your internal
ecc->read/write_page() implementations (all you'll have to do is avoid
using the ->cmdfunc() method and create your own NAND controller
specific commands instead), but it should at least be used for basic
operations that do not require high performances (i.e. NAND detection,
NAND RESET, read-retry, ...).
