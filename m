linux-mtd.git is prepped for a pull request. I'll do that before the
week ends. And I'll either merge that back into l2-mtd.git at that time,
or just pull in v4.3-rc4.

I'll see what I can apply after pulling together all the latest, but if
I'm still missing things then, feel free to resend.

BTW, I thought there were some things to address on the erased ECC stuff
still. I'll re-check that series too.
