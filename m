thanks for your suggestion.

I ever thought of this solution.

But i do not think this is not a good solution. :(

Firstly, the NOR flash S25FL128S may be used by other boards or other=20
platform.
So if other person uses the S25FL128S, he has to add the SPI NOR=20
command(such as 0xbe, 0xec),
this is really not needed. Why not add these SPI NOR command now?


Secondly, this controller not only needs the write/erase/read, but also=20
need other SPI NOR commands
such as Write-Enable/Read-status/Configurate the Register. if we add=20
these SPI NOR commands to
the DT binding, it will be more ugly to veryone. That's why the Patch 1=20
is needed.


The only value should be set in the DT is the _dummy_ value. But Add the=20
dummy support should be an other
patchset's job. I think it is a little complicated to add the dummy suppo=
rt.

The fast-read uses 8bit dummy, the quad-read may needs 6bit dummy, and=20
so on..

How can we transfer the dummy value to the device? Add a value to the=20
spi_transfer{}?
I planed to submit another patchset to fix the dummy issue, since it=20
maybe needs more discussion,
i did not include the dummy patches in this patch set.

we have 4 data I/O lines between the device and controller, i only need=20
the Quad mode. :)
