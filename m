Sorry, I missed the part about "each data transaction", got it now.

Thanks for the clarification, I think that is roughly what I thought it was,
but I'm still not sure about brcmstb. Is that related to bcm63xxx or separate?

Yes, I think this makes sense overall. Regarding the specific example, can you
clarify how the register areas in iproc are structured?

The 0xf8105408 and 0x18046f00 start addresses are not aligned to large powers
of two, which often indicates that they are part of some other, larger,
unit that might need to have a driver of its own, so before we specify
a binding like the one you proposed above I'd like to make sure we're not
getting ourselves into trouble later.
