At least that's a valid use-case which should be considered, but not
the only. Some people also just don't want to modify the bootloader
(especially on headless systems) so they don't risk to brick it.
Many devices offer some rescue firmware flashing methods through
TFTP -- however, you cannot change bootloader environment variables
like the cmdline in that way and even if you could, the loader might
still patch the root=... parameter in the way needed for their stock
firmware.

/me researching 'showopts' which I had never heard of before.
Ok, this is for grub running interactively on x86, probably not the
best reference if it comes to small headless embedded systems...
There is no such a thing as a proprietary board-specific version
of grub, so on x86 the whole problem just doesn't exist and showopts
is really just cosmetics. However, on most ARM, MIPS or PPC based
boards users may not have the option or may not want to change the
bootloader. As the whole reason why some distro-kernels then decide
to override the bootloader cmdline is *because* $vendor decided to
make her bootloader pass the root=... and similar basic options and
that screws up the rootfs of the 3rd-party Linux.
Thus I believe we shouldn't encourage the use of the kernel cmdline
in places the user cannot influence it (like in most $vendor variants
of U-Boot where the cmdline is patched somewhere behind the scenes
rather than just using the environment variable).

Exactly true. However, as the mtd partitions are defined in the tree
itself rather than using 'mtdparts=...' in the cmdline built-into the
device-tree, it'd be nice to also select that a specific partition
should be ubiattached.

Sorry, but we are not talking about traditional desktop or server
systems. OpenWrt/LEDE runs on devices with as little as 32 MB of RAM
and 4 MB of Flash. Devices with UBI will typically have at least
32 MB of NAND Flash, but still not necessarily a lot of RAM.
Have a look at
https://git.lede-project.org/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=target/linux/lantiq/dts/BTHOMEHUBV2B.dts
for a good example of the type of hardware we are talking about.

Apart from that we already automatically generate initramfs-based
images for devices to be used in situations where you cannot or don't
want to touch the devices' flash.
As there wasn't a need to embed a initramfs for anything as simple
as mounting the rootfs, I reckon it would be hard to argue that we
should have an initramfs for all systems potentially using UBI just
so we won't need those ~ 100 lines of C code added to the kernel to
auto-select the root device *and* filesystem for both MTD and UBI.

I agree with your view when it comes to describing UBI volumes
in the device tree. That's wrong just as it would be wrong to add
DT bindings for LVM2.
As said previously, the situation is different for flash chips having
partitions defined for use with UBI on some boards.
