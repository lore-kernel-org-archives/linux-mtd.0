Hm, defining aggregated mtd devices in the DT is not supported, and
since, as I've been told many times ;), DT is supposed to represent the
HW not what we want to do with it, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

Note that the infrastructure to concatenate several MTD devices
already exists, but it's not used by the NAND layer.

Also note that some NAND chips embed several dies and expose multiple
CS lines. The NAND framework already supports assigning different CS
lines to a single NAND device, so you could abuse this feature and
expose your different NAND devices as a single one (that will only work
for a cluster of identical chips connected to the same controller), but
I'd really like to avoid this kind of things.
