Well, for the DT case at least, what is the problem with including two
(or more) compatible strings in the board DT, but the driver only
binding against the common one ("m25p80" or something like
"spi-nor,jedec-id") unless necessary? You can still follow best DT
practices formally without always binding to the most specific string
when that doesn't buy you anything.

The true board file / platform data cases are slightly different, but in
those cases, the board file can evolve in sync with drivers, I think.
