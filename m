I don't see that it is my place to accept or reject the change.
I don't particularly like it, but I hope to never look at this code
against so you shouldn't put to much weight on what I like.

Simply rebooting the board is not a risky procedure.
The risk is that if something causes Linux to "crash", it may not reboot
properly.
