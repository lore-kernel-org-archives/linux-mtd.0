Not sure what these schema mean.

Nit: that would just be __packed (see compiler-gcc.h).

In principle, I'm OK with extending the BBT somewhat. Preferably, this
would provide some extensibility, so that other custom formats can use
the same base code. For instance, it looks like many of these fields
would be fixed, and specific to your platform. So (from nand_bbt's
perspective) these could just be consolidated int a field:

	u8 custom[76];

Or make it variable-length, with the length provided by the driver?
nand_bbt would just know not to check for it when scanning, and it
would know to program it to flash when updating.

Yeah, I realize you can't just jump over to the current format for
production systems. And there are admittedly some rough spots in our
current nand_bbt; it's not perfect.

Some random notes (not necessarily your problem; but things to be aware
of): nand_bbt could use some additional robustness checks, I think. Like
a CRC field, and maybe a versioning system for allowing
(backwards-compatible) changes in the format. To make
backwards-compatible changes, though, the original format needs to have
reserved space, or at least an 'offset' field, which would point to
where the actual BBT starts--not just a fixed offset.

There's also still a bit of cruft that really can be removed from
nand_bbt (the handling of bad block markers, which is duplicated in
nand_base). It's a low-priority item on my plate, but I think it might
be a good first step before trying to expand nand_bbt much.
