Doesn't that mean you need to disable quad mode on removal? Else the
following will break/fail:

insmod atmel-quadspi.ko ~> spi-nor attaches -> sees micron -> enables quad mode
rmmod atmel-quadspi.ko ~> spi-nor detaches
insmod atmel-quadspi.ko ~> spi-nor attaches -> fails to read the id
because flash is still in quad mode.

Shouldn't the default assumption be that it won't support it? Also it
might make sense to first check if it's supported before enabling it
in the chip, so that we don't enable something just to then find out
we can't back out of it.

I also wonder if we need an extra flag for that as at least SPI has
RX_{DUAL,QUAD} and TX_{DUAL,QUAD} separated, so in theory there could
be a controller that supports quad read, but not quad write, so we
shouldn't be using the quad mode in that case. m25p80 currently sets
SPI_NOR_{DUAL,QUAD} only based on SPI_RX_{DUAL,QUAD}, so that would
then fail.

At least the n25q32 seems to support the "boring" 1_1_2 and 1_1_4
commands, so these should work in case the spi controller does not
support quad tx, but quad rx.

So maybe an additional flag for the "full" dual/quad modes would be in order.

Last but not least, the protocol probably should be stored somewhere
in the nor struct, so that users don't have to store it themselves (I
assume they will need to check it for each command again to know if
the cmd/address should be send in serial or quad mode).
