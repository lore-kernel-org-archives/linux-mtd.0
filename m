And sorry, but I don't think reworking the pxa3xx driver this way is a
good idea. As I was saying, I'd like to rework it and doing this would
be useless once the rework is done.

In the Berlin specific cmdfunc we have ~10 lines copied from the others
cmd functions. That's not much. The pxa3xx driver is already factorized
and not a lot of functions are SoC-specific, except the cmdfunc which is
not that long. So you would want me to move all the driver to
mrvl-nand-lib and have a berlin_nand.c file with less than 100 lines
(i.e only its cmdfunc)? Thant would introduce small specific probing
functions and driver definitions and increase the code size, wouldn't
it?

Well, I think that would not be the refactoring needed for this driver.

I may have been missing something. If so, please explain me which
code part is not factorized (except for the first 10 lines of the
cmd functions, which I can factorize if you really want it) and how the
driver would benefit from this?

Thanks,

Antoine
