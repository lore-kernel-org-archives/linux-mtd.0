That's assuming you're talking about NAND, and that no one has devised
any clever partition scheme that is robust against bad blocks. I've seen
attempts at the latter, but nothing widely used. And eventually, you're
just reimplementing UBI anyway.

About the former: some systems will still use a dual-flash system, where
they get reliable partition information from a NOR flash to bootstrap
getting the NAND up and running. So it's possible to avoid sticking all
partitions in DT.

It's not completely useless, but it's difficult for real technical
reasons: many SoCs boot straight off address 0 of a flash (hopefully
something reliable like NOR flash, but I've even seen that for NAND...),
so you can't possibly put a partition table there. That doesn't preclude
coming up with a decent non-0-address-based scheme, but nobody's really
done that generically, although there are various vendor-specific
attempts to just progressively scan all blocks on the flash -- see a few
drivers/mtd/*part.c.
