FWIW, this comment still stands. I cannot take your patch as-is.

Wow, what a joke. (Please quote me to your IP "designer.")

In any case, there's no way I'm going to support a ton of new
"*-nonjedec" strings just to support your completely broken controller.
These aren't actually "nonjedec" flash devices, and AFAICT, there's
absolutely nothing wrong with the flash that requires this description.
It's purely your controller's fault.

Thus, I'm not changing the DT binding for all the flash you want to use.

Instead, I think we need to assume that your controller is completely
incapable of identifying the flash that's attached to it, and instead
just rely on specifying this entirely in the device tree. Then, we need
a flag for your driver to notify spi-nor.c that it can't trust the READ
ID command at all, and it must instead rely strictly on flash string
matching. e.g. something like:

	ret = of_modalias_node(np, name, sizeof(name)); /* e.g., name = "n25q016" */
	if (ret < 0)
		return ret;
	nor->controller_flags |= SPI_NOR_MY_CONTROLLER_SUCKS_AND_CANT_DO_READID;
	ret = spi_nor_scan(nor, name, mode);

along with something like this in spi-nor.c:
