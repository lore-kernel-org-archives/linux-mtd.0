Ok. fixed this to "ti,davinci-chipselect"

Ok, fixed.

I found the following used options:

ecc_mode:
NAND_ECC_NONE
NAND_ECC_SOFT
NAND_ECC_HW
NAND_ECC_HW_SYNDROME

bbt_options:
NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH

ecc_bits:
1
4

options:
NAND_BUSWIDTH_16

Ok, so, should I introduce instead properties for the above
needed parameters? (As this are not davinci specific parameters,
are there somewhere such definitions for them?)

Ok.
