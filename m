Looks like they forgot mailers work with text, not preservation of
octets, and mailers mangle the octets in standardised ways, so a bit
of unmangling is needed on occasions.

It would need to optional for git users whose source code isn't UTF-8 -
possibly converting the other way for them.  But yeah I think it'd make
sense to be on by default.

Section 4.1.2, Charset Parameter, final paragraph:

It's a SHOULD, but it's still a good idea.  ISO-8859-1 is still very
widely-used for email.

Also in that section:

Obviously not - RFC2045 does not recommend that, so mailers don't do it
in their default configurations.  But they do recode text into the
lowest common charset that can represent the text.  In practice that
means no effect on ASCII, but does affect some non-ASCII characters.

Mutt out of the box tries us-ascii / iso-8859-1 / utf-8, in that order,
to maximise the chance of recipients being able to read the mail.  Even
on a fully 21st-century-ised Linux with UTF-8 terminals etc. :-) I don't
know what other mailers do, sorry, but I'd expect them to do the same.
