Why __raw_readb()? That's not normally encourage, and it has issues with
endianness. It looks like maybe this is actulaly a 32-bit register, and
you're having trouble when trying to do bytewise access? I see this
earlier:

/*
 * ECC status is stored at NFC_CFG[ECCADD] +4 for little-endian
 * and +7 for big-endian SoCs.
 */
#ifdef __LITTLE_ENDIAN
#define ECC_OFFSET      4
#else
#define ECC_OFFSET      7
#endif

So maybe you really just want:

#define ECC_OFFSET	4
...
	ecc_status = vf610_nfc_read(ECC_SRAM_ADDR * 8 + ECC_OFFSET) & 0xff;

?

Another side note: why are you using ecc_count as a max threshold? AIUI,
an ECC algorithm doesn't really report useful error count information if
it's above the correction limit. So wouldn't we be looking to count up
to our SW threshold? i.e., ecc.strength / 2, or similar? Similar
comments below.

Hmm, that's not really good. The point is that we need to make sure that
everything that could have been programmed (including the ECC area) was
not actually programmed. But your ECC controller is not, contrary to
MTD's expectations, dumping raw uncorrected data here.

That's not the intention of my suggestion. You're still missing out on a
class of patterns that might look close to all 0xff but are not
actually.

If the HW ECC really doesn't give you valid data+OOB at this point, then
you might have to re-read with ECC disabled. Of course, that's got a
performance cost...

Or perhaps Boris has a better suggestion? He's been surveying other NAND
drivers that need to do similar things, and he's working on providing
some support code for common design patterns.

I'm a little confused there. Why would you be expecting to get a count
of bitflips, when the ECC engine can't correct all errors? How is it
supposed to know what the "right" data is if the bit errors are beyond
the correction strength?
