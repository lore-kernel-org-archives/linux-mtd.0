Squashfs has much larger block sizes than cramfs (last time I looked it 
was limited to 4K blocks), and it compresses the metadata which helps to 
get better compression.  But tail merging (fragments in Squashfs 
terminology) is obviously a major reason why Squashfs gets good compression.

The AXFS code is rather obscure but it doesn't look to me that it does 
tail merging.  The following code wouldn't work if the block in question 
was a tail contained in a larger block.  It assumes the block extends to 
the end of the compressed block (cblk_size - cnode_offset).

Perhaps the AXFS authors could clarify this?
