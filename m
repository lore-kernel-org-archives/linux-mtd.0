Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- use proper markups for titles;
- adjust section identation;
- use proper markup for notes and fix it to properly show the
  numbered list.

-Introduction:
-
-	The hw_random framework is software that makes use of a
-	special hardware feature on your CPU or motherboard,
-	a Random Number Generator (RNG).  The software has two parts:
-	a core providing the /dev/hwrng character device and its
-	sysfs support, plus a hardware-specific driver that plugs
-	into that core.
-
-	To make the most effective use of these mechanisms, you
-	should download the support software as well.  Download the
-	latest version of the "rng-tools" package from the
-	hw_random driver's official Web site:
-
-		http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
-
-	Those tools use /dev/hwrng to fill the kernel entropy pool,
-	which is used internally and exported by the /dev/urandom and
-	/dev/random special files.

-Theory of operation:
-
-	CHARACTER DEVICE.  Using the standard open()
-	and read() system calls, you can read random data from
-	the hardware RNG device.  This data is NOT CHECKED by any
-	fitness tests, and could potentially be bogus (if the

-	output if the hardware "has-data" flag is set, but nevertheless

-About the Intel RNG hardware, from the firmware hub datasheet:
 
-	The Firmware Hub integrates a Random Number Generator (RNG)
-	using thermal noise generated from inherently random quantum
-	mechanical properties of silicon. When not generating new random
-	bits the RNG circuitry will enter a low power state. Intel will
-	provide a binary software driver to give third party software
-	access to our RNG for use as a security feature. At this time,
-	the RNG is only to be used with a system in an OS-present state.
