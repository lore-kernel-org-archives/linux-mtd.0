No, kernel build is, for evident reasons, one of the workloads I cared
most about.  Actually, I tried to focus on all my main
kernel-development tasks, such as also git checkout, git merge, git
grep, ...

According to my test results, with BFQ these tasks are at least as
fast as, or, in most system configurations, much faster than with the
other schedulers.  Of course, at the same time the system also remains
responsive with BFQ.

You can repeat these tests using one of my first scripts in the S
suite: kern_dev_tasks_vs_rw.sh (usually, the older the tests, the more
hypertrophied the names I gave :) ).

I stopped sharing also my kernel-build results years ago, because I
went on obtaining the same, identical good results for years, and I'm
aware that I tend to show and say too much stuff.

Thanks,
Paolo
