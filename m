This could be used as a reverse argument, issuing a reset will increase
the boot time.

Then instead of adding a "reset flag" to Device Tree, another approach
could be to put the desired or currently configured exhaustive list of
NAND timings in Device Tree, and based on that you could have this:

- the NAND controller driver finds that these timings match the current
configuration, you are good to go

- the NAND controller drivers finds a difference in how current timings
are configured vs. desired timings, and issues a controller reset, prior
to applying new timing configuration

- no timings are configured, reset the controller and use existing
auto-detection capabilities like ONFI modes

Typically you would put the desired timings instead of the currently
configured timings though..

It seems to me like having this property is fine as long as you are
describing that the controller *needs* a reset to operate properly, it
does not strike me as a particularly well suited property if its side
effect and main usage is to keep or wipe-out existing NAND timings.
