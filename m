Right now, users of host-managed SMR drives should be using "deadline"
or "mq-deadline", to avoid out-of-order writes in sequential-only
zones.

I'm running into a situation right now on a test system (Fedora 28,
4.18.7 kernel) where I copied test data onto an F2FS filesystem, but I
accidentally forgot to add my "udev rule" file:

# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-zoned-block-devices.rules
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]",
ATTRS{queue/zoned}=="host-managed", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="deadline"

...and now, I see these messages when that specific SMR drive is mounted:

kernel: F2FS-fs (sdc): IO Block Size:        4 KB
kernel: F2FS-fs (sdc): Found nat_bits in checkpoint
kernel: F2FS-fs (sdc): Mounted with checkpoint version = 212216ab
kernel: mpt3sas_cm0: log_info(0x31080000): originator(PL), code(0x08),
sub_code(0x0000)
kernel: mpt3sas_cm0: log_info(0x31080000): originator(PL), code(0x08),
sub_code(0x0000)
kernel: scsi_io_completion: 20 callbacks suppressed
kernel: sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK

kernel: sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Sense Key : Aborted Command [current]
kernel: sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Add. Sense: No additional sense information
kernel: sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: Write(16) 8a 00 00 00 00 00 3d d4
ec 99 00 00 00 80 00 00

I was also running into problems with creating new directories on this
F2FS filesystem.  However, "fsck.f2fs" reports no problems.  So at
this point, I created a new F2FS filesystem on a second SMR drive, and
am currently copying the data from the "bad" F2FS filesystem to the
"good" one.

I wouldn't call zoned block devices "fragile"; they simply have I/O
rules that didn't previously exist: all writes to sequential-only
zones must be sequential.  And one of the things that schedulers do is
reorder writes.  After 4.16, sd stopped being the "gatekeeper" of
ensuring sequential writes, but the only "zoned-aware" schedulers were
deadline and mq-deadline.  Since my test system defaulted to "cfq", I
ran into problems.

So I welcome any changes that make it impossible for the user to
"accidentally use the wrong scheduler".

At least this time, I didn't "brick" my test system's BIOS, like I did
back in May of this year [1].


Thanks,

Bryan
