At least not in our case. The first level bootloader is entered on
resume just as it is on a POR event, with the exception that the D3S
bit in the ASCR register is set in this case. We unconditionally
initialize the static and dynamic memory controllers and then either
jump to the routine that initializes the NAND controller, read the 2nd
level loader and pass control to it. Or (in the resume case) we just
jump to the address stored at the RAM address 0x80000000 (which has
been set to cpu_resume previously) and thus enter the kernel again. No
NAND operations in the game in this case, and this has always worked
fine.

I think the problem is just the opposite. The driver expects the setup
registers to retain their state over suspend, and doesn't write them
again, and this causes operations to fail after resume.
