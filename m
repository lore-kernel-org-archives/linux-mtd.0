On a first glance this looks good to me, and looks easily extensible
for application of non-complete partition parsers.

E.g. for the "brcm,bcm6345-imagetag" we would want to actually do something like

partitions {
    ....

    partition@0 {
        reg = <0x0 0x10000>;
        label = "cfe";
        read-only;
    };

    partition@10000 {
        reg = <0x10000 0x3d0000>;
        label = "firmware";
        compatible = "brcm,bcm6345-imagetag";
    };

    partition@3e0000 {
        reg = <0x3e0000 0x10000>;
        label = "art";
        read-only;
    };

   partition@3f0000 {
        reg = <0x3f0000 0x10000>;
        label = "nvram";
        read-only;
    };
};

as the image tag can only specify the offsets and sizes of the rootfs
and kernel parts, but not of any other parts.

I would assume a lot of the cases these would be a chicken-egg
problem, you need the parser to be able to find and mount the rootfs,
but you you need mount the rootfs to load the parser.

I agree fully that this is a bad binding, as it exposes internal names
that aren't supposed to be fixed.
