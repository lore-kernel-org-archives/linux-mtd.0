Still don't see how it can be used in real world (or maybe I don't
understand how it works).

Say the CS are both selected at the same time, this means you'll send
the same set of data to the 2 chips, right. I see two use cases for
this:
1/ You have 2 chips connected to the same data bus, CS, RB and CLE/ALE
   lines and you want to mirror data written on chip0 on chip1
2/ You have 2 chips connected to the same CS, RB, CLE/ALE lines, but
   chip0 is using the lower 8bits of the bus, and chip1 is using the
   remaining 8bits. This way you fake an 16bits bus

Both cases are unsafe, because of NAND unreliability. Say you're
writing on a block in chip0 this block in chip1 is bad. One of your
write will succeed, the other one will fail.

Could you give a real use case where this 'bank-select' method is
really usefull (and safe)?
If you can't, then drop this mode for now, and always operate in
'chip-enable' mode.

Yes, but I'd still like to see a proper NAND controller/NAND chip
separation in you binding.

Okay, maybe it's worth keeping this property if the AND logic is
integrated in the SoC.

Not really, at least if you properly separate the chip and controller
objects it's quite easy to deal with, and I'll ask you to do this clean
separation anyway (even if you say you only have a single chip per
controller) :P.

Yep. The sunxi_nand driver is using allwinner,rb = <X>.

Keep in mind that you're defining a DT binding, and this binding is
submitting to the 'stable ABI' rule, so you shouldn't think in term of
what your driver supports now, but what you're IP is capable of, and
it's definitely capable of handling several R/B pins.

Then you should have a way to retrieve these informations (proper clk
drivers, specific bus drivers, or any other means).

And my answer is no :). Just because it's complicated to extract
these information at the driver level level doesn't mean you should put
it in the DT. That's exactly the opposite: the DT is supposed to encode
the hardware representation, not how you want to configure it.

Nope, they should not be defined in the DT at all.

How about using a default/safe timing mode for now (ONFI timing mode 0
should work for all NANDs).
The only thing you'll have to do is retrieve the source clk rate and
calculate timing register values accordingly. Or you can even assume
you always have a 100MHz source clk and hardcode it in your driver.

Yes, and your NAND chip should be a sub-node of the NAND controller
node (and not mixed together as you've done here).
