I'm not sure security is the main concern here.
AFAICT, NAND scramblers (note that I stopped using the name "randomizer"
:-)) is mainly used to avoid large island of identical data, because
some NAND chips are sensible to such patterns (see [1] page 14).

The proposed solution leave the scrambling process to the scrambler
implementation, thus it is possible to provide a different seed for each
block.
And this is exactly what's done in the sunxi HW  scrambler
implementation, or at least you can do it based on what you're
specifying in your DT (see the "nand-randomizer-seeds" in the 3rd
patch): you can define a seed table and the seed is selected based on
the page number you're reading or writing.

Actually the seed table is configurable per-partition and this is why I
depend on the "per-partition ECC config" series.
