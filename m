Ok, fix this. Id means here, which chipselect the controller uses.
Maybe it is better to rename it to "chipselect" ?

You think something like that:

davinci-mask-ale
davinci-mask-cle
...

?

Ok, I add the defines here, and add also a comment in the dts.

I think so, because this values come from existing platform code
(grep for struct davinci_nand_pdata)

I mapped here just the existing platform code (=struct davinci_nand_pdata)
to OF, so existing boards can easy switch to OF.

Comment in arch/arm/mach-davinci/include/mach/nand.h says for
mask_ale and mask_cle:

/* NOTE:  boards don't need to use these address bits
 * for ALE/CLE unless they support booting from NAND.
 * They're used unless platform data overrides them.
 */

It is used for addressing the ALE/CLE Signals through the address,
used on the arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-dm646x-evm.c and
arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-tnetv107x-evm.c board ... so I think,
this should be also be setupable through OF ...

There is no reason for that, change this to "nand@".

Thanks for the review.
