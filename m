OK, so you are saying that LBA n + 1 will share its keystream with LBA
n but shift by 64 blocks, right? Yeah, that's terrible.

But I severely dislike having to make the fscrypt code intimately
aware of this. Why can't we just encrypt the IV like we do for
AES-CBC? We already pull in that code for the filenames anyway.
Alternatively, we could have a IV mangling wrapper around chacha20
that moves this special handling out of fscrypt.
