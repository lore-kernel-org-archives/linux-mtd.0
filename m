D'oh, I totally missed your open-coded le32_to_cpu macro.
So your code does look correct to me, it's just a little inefficient
on big-endian machines because you end up swapping twice.

That would work, and avoid the double swapping, yes. Or you could
use writesl() with a length of one, which should have all the
necessary barriers but no byteswap.

I don't think you need a barrier on ARM here (no DMA that can interfere),
but it's better write the code architecture independent (as you did
above).

The memcpy_toio() is definitely overkill as it has a barrier after every
single byte, where you need at most one for this kind of driver.

Correct.

No, what I meant is that you are replacing some memcpy_toio() with
writel(), but don't replace some of the others that should/could also
be replaced.

As mentioned, I was under the impression that you changed the endianess
for the OOB data but did not change the endianess for the user data,
which would be inconsistent.

Brian or Dwmw2 should be able to know for sure. I think it's definitely
worth trying as the potential performance gains could be huge, if you
replace

	for (p = start; p < start + length; data++, p++) {
		writeb(*data, p);
		wmb();
	}

with

	for (p = start; p < start + length; data++, p+=4) {
		writel(*data, p);
	};
	wmb();
