More friendly explanation: because spi_get_device_id uses driver's
id_table (that was now changes to pure strings).
I see the point.

We could simply follow the way Linux-specific platform data works. We
could always use
compatible =3D "m25p80";
and then for some rare cases (where JEDEC fails) add something like
model =3D "at25df321a";

I agree, however there is already a patch in progress handling that:

Flashes not supporting JEDEC are usually some weird versions of normal
flashes with JEDEC support. So I think we could still have them in the
spi-nor database and let users provide the name instead of filling the
whole struct flash_info.
