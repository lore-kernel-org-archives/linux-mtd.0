There is another class of outliers: host-managed SMR disks (SATA and SCSI,=
=0A=
definitely single hw queue). For these, using mq-deadline is mandatory in m=
any=0A=
cases in order to guarantee sequential write command delivery to the device=

driver. Having the default changed to bfq, which as far as I know is not SM=

friendly (can sequential writes within a single zone be reordered ?) is ask=
ing=0A=
for troubles (unaligned write errors showing up).=0A=
=0A=
A while back, we already had this discussion with Jens and Christoph on the=
 list=0A=
to allow device drivers to set a sensible default I/O scheduler for devices=

"special needs" (e.g. host-managed SMR). At the time, the conclusion was th=

Of note also is that host-managed like sequential zone devices are also lik=

to show up soon with the work being done in the NVMe standard on the new "Z=
