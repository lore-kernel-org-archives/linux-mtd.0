yes, Boris write the code snippet. I taken it and format it as a patch.

sounds the proper way. I will do that.

After this patch is applied, then we can apply following patch for NFC's 
dts,

                                 reg = <
-                                       0x90000000 0x10000000   /* NFC 
Command Registers */
+                                      0x90000000 0x08000000   /* NFC 
Command Registers */
                                         0xfc05c000 0x00000070   /* NFC 
HSMC regs */
                                         0x00100000 0x00100000   /* NFC 
SRAM banks */
                                          >;
                                 clocks = <&hsmc_clk>;

But as this change should go to the at91-dt, so I would like make the 
nand driver patch is accepted first. Then send out the dts changes.

I would change this to:

"Time out to wait for NFC ready!\n");

Thanks.
