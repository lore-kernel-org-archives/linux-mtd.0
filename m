no, it seems that my patch is merged in mtd git tree after your changes. 
So when you do the bitflips patch, my patch is not existed in that 
moment.  :)

yes, I just noticed this. I think in the v2 patch, I included this fix too.

Thanks for all the detail information, that is very clear to me. I will 
send out v2 patch soon.
