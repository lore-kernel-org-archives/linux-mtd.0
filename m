I agree that it is likely that specific KDF implementations may only be use=
d=20
once. But still, I would recommend to maintain those implementation under t=
he=20
crypto API umbrella, as KDFs are cryptographic operations.

I concur with you. I have implemented the HKDF in my libkcapi as well and s=
aw=20
the need for a salt.

Let me work on an update to the KDF patch for the kernel crypto API.
