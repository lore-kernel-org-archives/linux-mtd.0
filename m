Yeah, I know it was a workaround. It's another issue of balancing time
and the "best" solution. Of course, the solutions actually don't seem
that difficult now, so I probably should have just fixed the ioctl()
in the first place... But I was simply pointing this out as evidence
of a real memory-fragmentation issue.

That's one way, but it would require specifying some arbitrary
iteration length, right? Like some multiple of writesize?

Instead, how about modelling it more closely after mtdchar_write(),
using mtd_kmalloc_up_to(), then iteratively call copy_from_user()?

It sounds OK, but that depends on the success rate of
dma_alloc_from_contiguous(). I'm not familiar with it.
