I made the changes at my side here. However, there are something i
want to confirm with you:
 - in spi-nor.h, i add 2 functions. _lock and _unlock instead of lock
and unlock. It is because we already have struct mutex lock with the
same name.
    int (*_lock)(struct spi_nor *nor, loff_t offs, uint64_t len);
    int (*_unlock)(struct spi_nor *nor, loff_t offs, uint64_t len);
- in spi-nor.c, i change the current spi_nor_lock and spi_nor_unlock
to stmicro_spi_nor_lock and stmirco_spi_nor_unlock
- in spi-nor.c, i add 2 functions:

static int spi_nor_lock(struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t ofs, uint64_t len)
{
    struct spi_nor *nor = mtd_to_spi_nor(mtd);
    int ret = 0;

    ret = spi_nor_lock_and_prep(nor, SPI_NOR_OPS_LOCK);
    if (ret)
        return ret;

    /* Wait until finished previous command */
    ret = wait_till_ready(nor);
    if (ret)
        goto err;

    ret = nor->_lock(nor, ofs, len);

err:
    spi_nor_unlock_and_unprep(nor, SPI_NOR_OPS_LOCK);
    return ret;
}

static int spi_nor_unlock(struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t ofs, uint64_t len)
{
    struct spi_nor *nor = mtd_to_spi_nor(mtd);
    int ret = 0;

    ret = spi_nor_lock_and_prep(nor, SPI_NOR_OPS_LOCK);
    if (ret)
        return ret;

    /* Wait until finished previous command */
    ret = wait_till_ready(nor);
    if (ret)
        goto err;

    ret = nor->_unlock(nor, ofs, len);

err:
    spi_nor_unlock_and_unprep(nor, SPI_NOR_OPS_LOCK);
    return ret;
}

- Then under spi_nor_scan function, i add these few lines:
    /* nor protection support for STmicro chips */
    if (JEDEC_MFR(info->jedec_id) == CFI_MFR_ST) {
        mtd->_lock = stmicro_spi_nor_lock;
        mtd->_unlock = stmicro_spi_nor_unlock;
    } else {
        mtd->_lock = spi_nor_lock;
        mtd->_unlock = spi_nor_unlock;
    }

I think the code should be like this:

    if (sector_start >= num_sectors / 2)
        sr_bp = fls(num_sectors - 1 - sector_start) + 1;
    else if ((sector_end < num_sectors / 2)
        sr_bp = fls(sector_end) + 1;
    else
        sr_bp = 16; /* lock all areas */
