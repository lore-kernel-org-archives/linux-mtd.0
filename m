I think it might work.

Your quote from that thread:

  "I think that a DT node is always supposed to include a compatible
  string for the specific device.  It could also include a generic
  compatible string for SPI NOR chips, but the *only* thing a driver can
  do with that is to use the JEDEC ID command.  It can't even
  generically read a single byte, since addresses may be either 3 or 4
  bytes long!  So I think that if a generic compatible string is
  defined, the DT binding must also define the properties that spi-nor
  currently reads out of its static table."

For every current entry (except the "*-nonjedec" entries; I don't think
we should be supporting any more entries like this, and I'd like to kill
the existing ones if possible), we can do just that; read out the JEDEC
ID and go from there. (Rafal is also looking at non-JEDEC RDID commands,
but that would just require a different type of binding.)

In fact, for most of these entries, we'll read out the ID and override
the match provided by the driver anyway. See:

int spi_nor_scan(...)
{
...
	[Note: almost all 'info' entries provide a non-zero jedec_id field]
	if (info->jedec_id) {
		const struct spi_device_id *jid;

		jid = nor->read_id(nor);
		if (IS_ERR(jid)) {
			return PTR_ERR(jid);
		} else if (jid != id) {
			/*
			 * JEDEC knows better, so overwrite platform ID. We
			 * can't trust partitions any longer, but we'll let
			 * mtd apply them anyway, since some partitions may be
			 * marked read-only, and we don't want to lose that
			 * information, even if it's not 100% accurate.
			 */
			dev_warn(dev, "found %s, expected %s\n",
				 jid->name, id->name);
			id = jid;
			info = (void *)jid->driver_data;
		}
	}
...
}

I think this chunk might be reworked (or at least, modify the comments)
to note how we primarily expect to override the input ID. We might even
drop the dev_warn() eventually, and make it more informative instead.

Right. I think it may turn out better to drop it and force a redesign
for the next user.

Maybe struct flash_info, but this still leaks more spi-nor.c internal
info into drivers. Perhaps Rafal's use case could be served by a
select-able 'READ ID' opcode, with his flash_info structs still stored
in spi_nor_ids[] -- or possibly as a separate ID table within spi-nor.c.

But either way, I agree the current read_id() hook is not satisfactory.
