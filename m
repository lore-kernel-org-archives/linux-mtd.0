This series of patches adds support for the Dreamcast Visual Memory
Unit, reworking the maple bus code to ensure it supports asynchronous
reads and writes. A consequential amendment to the keyboard and joystick
drivers are also included.

This version (v5) fixes a memory leak in the VMU code that was present
when read or write requests timed out in v4. It also adds the joystick
fix.

The VMU is a 'smart' flash chip where access is controlled by a
microcontroller so that, for instance, flash erases appear to be
transparent to the end user. The VMU does, however, show typical
flash-type behaviour (eg phased writes) and the MTD layer and the chip
work well together (eg in the way they handle apparent hotplug events
during a block write).

This version tidies up some style issues raised with version 2.
