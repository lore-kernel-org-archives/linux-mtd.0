Right.

No. At this point, I would consider that to be a legacy method. We still
have to support this for many cases (including the non-DT case; but
hopefully we can do better than that soon), and that would be an option.

Yeah...sorry if I wasn't too clear. And I definitely don't blame you for
not understanding the mess that MTD often is :(

No, that's not what I was intending. The binding before commmit
fe2585e9c29a ("doc: dt: mtd: support partitions in a special
'partitions' subnode") should still stay working as-is. That is, we
don't mess with the way things worked for anything that doesn't have a
'partitions' subnode. But now that we have a 'partitions' subnode (in
4.4-rc1), I'm just suggesting that we enforce this always have a
compatible property, so we can be more clear on the difference between:

	partitions {
		// do I have a
		// compatible = "partitons";
		// here?

		partition@0 {
			label = "foo-partition";
			reg = <0 0x100000>;
		};
	};

and

	partitions {
		compatible = "arm,arm-flash-structure";

		subnode {
			// what if we need something here eventually?
		};
	};

This would require some modifications to partitions.txt and to
drivers/mtd/ofpart.c.

> A bit confused here, I can't really see what I should do with the patch...

Hopefully that cleared up a bit? The code changes for my suggestion
would just be something like this, I think. (Not tested in any way.)

I was just bringing this up for discussion, since it's related to
your/Rob's new proposal. I'll send a proper (and tested) patch, along
with a doc update, if that looks reasonable.
