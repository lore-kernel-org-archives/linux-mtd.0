You're right about the English definition of period, however, what
bothers me here is that the clk_period is actually representing the
time of clk cycle, while the period argument is not related at all
with a cyclic event, and this can lead misinterpretations.
Anyway, this is just a detail (but I'd still prefer duration over
period ;-)).

Best Regards,

Boris
