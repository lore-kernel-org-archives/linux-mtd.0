Great! See, much of that could be done by reading your own code (yeah,
yeah, not "yours"; but still) and honestly dealing with my questions,
rather than giving up and deferring to me or your MIA authorities. I'm
happy to return to technical points and avoid the other unpleasantness.

OK, this is all familiar. This is common to many other systems.

This is the part where we differ, I suppose. The "as long as possible"
statement is still not sufficient; I believe this still leaves holes
that simply cannot be fixed in Linux.

You're right: power cuts shouldn't be a problem. But what about other
unexpected warm resets? (Watchdogs?) Do you have any solution for them?

Then maybe we can't solve this. That doesn't mean that upstream will
support you, though.

Problems like this are why "release early, release often" makes sense.
If your employer didn't take the "fire the engineers and dump software
support to the community" approach, but rather honestly engaged on
driver support earlier, then perhaps your employer could have fixed the
SoCs/boot ROMs/board designs earlier, rather than later, and you
wouldn't be stuck trying to wedge in upstream workarounds for bad
designs in the wild.
