I see your point and it makes sense, I just think it shouldn't be part
of spi-nor. By adding chip specific code to spi-nor we'll end with
hacky code and possible false chips identifications. I can really
easily imagine some random chip having the same id[3] and id[4] as one
of Altera flashes.

Moreover your patch has not working support for epcs16 and epcs64.
They don't support 0x9f opcode (SPINOR_OP_RDID), so you would need to
add support for 0xab ("Read silicon ID") to the spi-nor.

It's the same problem I have with Broadcom's "w25q128" that doesn't
support 0x9f opcode but a 0x90 with 16b reply. You may see my tiny
bcm53xxspiflash.c driver:
http://git.openwrt.org/?p=3Dopenwrt.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dtarget/linux/bcm53xx/f=
iles/drivers/mtd/spi-nor/bcm53xxspiflash.c;h=3Df192f4e59b71a2444833b5c62dd2=
239d28f9435d;hb=3Dd105c51a428a72a9af42759c472df9960c496d67

So I'm afraid that if spi-nor gets support for:
1) 0xab opcode
2) 0x90 opcode
3) Some uncommon replies for 0x9f opcode (like Altera ones)
it will quickly get hacky & buggy.

So what about:
1) Using 0x9f and 0xab in altera_epcq.c
2) Finding chip name in altera_epcq.c
3) Adding Altera chip names & all sizes to spi-nor.c
4) Just passing a chip name to spi-nor.c

It's something I do in bcm53xxspiflash.c. I detect w25q128 using some
specific 0x90 opcode and just pass a chip name to the spi-nor.
