No, maybe paranoid is fine. I was just bringing it up. Being too
liberal in what you accept can create compatibility problems later. So
if you wait to handle generalities until you see them in practice, you
can potentially save yourself some problems.

Sure there are. I've been seeing non-ONFI parts from Toshiba and
Macronix, at least (I think Macronix is moving to ONFI soon, though).
Samsung is around still, too.

Right, I agree with a follow-up, and only if necessary. I was just
trying to plant the seeds of thought for you, so we don't run into a
maintenance problem such as Huang's gpmi-nand has. And as long as you
can plan a reasonable forward/backward-compatible solution for any
currently-supported configurations, then you don't need to add the DT
binding at all, if you don't currently need it. This is where the
paranoid approach can help you, too.

I don't see a patch for Documentation/mtd/nand/... Am I missing something?

My memory fails me, I guess. You did answer some of my questions, but
I was still left with some more. I failed to follow up properly...

>From the linked response:

"So, if you set the controller to transfer 2048B you can correct up to
16 bits on this 2048B region, or 4 bits per 512B, hence BCH-4."

Well, "16 bits per 2048" is at least as good as BCH-4 over 512B, but
it is not exactly the same. A true "16 bits per 2048" would be able to
correct 16 bitflips concentrated in a 512B region, whereas BCH-4/512B
would not.

But unless we can get better documentation/experiments with the
controller, it's hard to tell which is the case, and it's probably not
a big deal at this point. Your current code looks OK, I think.

Because MTD/NAND now implements a bitflip threshold based on the
reported ECC strength and step size. See commit:

  commit edbc4540e02c201bdd4f4d498ebb6ed517fd36e2
  Author: Mike Dunn <mikedunn@newsguy.com>
  Date:   Wed Apr 25 12:06:11 2012 -0700

      mtd: driver _read() returns max_bitflips; mtd_read() returns -EUCLEAN

and some of the other related code and documentation, such as in this commit:

  commit d062d4ede877fcd2ecc4c6262abad09a6f32950a
  Author: Mike Dunn <mikedunn@newsguy.com>
  Date:   Wed Apr 25 12:06:08 2012 -0700

      mtd: bitflip_threshold added to mtd_info and sysfs

If you don't have the correct strength, then this may not work as
intended. (I realized now that the ECC step size doesn't play a part
in the bitflip threshold process; only the strength is required to be
correct.)

...and now that I bring this up, I see that pxa3xx_nand.c has not been
updated to report 'max_bitflips' via return code from
pxa3xx_nand_read_page_hwecc(). This needs fixed. I wonder how many
other drivers are similarly broken. I just realized that my
out-of-tree driver is broken for this feature :(

I was not suggesting you need to implement these functions.

If I've missed any other important questions, please bear with me and
repeat them.

Thanks,
Brian
