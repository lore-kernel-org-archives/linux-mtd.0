The thing is, even using the last N bytes is depending on the encryption
algorithm.  The only way to make it work for arbitrary algorithms would be to
use a cryptographic hash like SHA-256 --- which actually seems to have been the
original design, but apparently it got changed at some point.  (I guess so that
hashes wouldn't have to be computed in so many places, and taking advantage of
the encryption should be sufficient.)

HEH is not a problem because it's a strong pseudorandom permutation, so any
choice of bytes from the ciphertext is equally good for it.

We can always change this later if different algorithms are added, or even make
different algorithms choose different bytes.

So I think I'm leaning towards making it use the second-to-last block, rather
than the last 32 bytes.
