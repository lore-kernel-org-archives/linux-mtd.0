Do you have anything more recent? All of these predate the current
code (by a lot), and isn't even mq. I'm mostly just interested in
plain fast NVMe device, and a big box hardware raid setup with
a ton of drives.

I do still think that this should be going through the distros, they
need to be the ones driving this, as they will ultimately be the
ones getting customer reports on regressions. The qual/test cycle
they do is useful for this. In mainline, if we make a change like
this, we'll figure out if it worked many releases down the line.
