My old config is made by myself. I think it was a wrong config,
and it had too much difference from the config made by 'make mxs_defconfig".

So i think it's has no use for debugging.

it's not a DMA bug, I discuss with Koen, and make sure that the bug is
caused by the GPMI or BCH.

it's a different bug from  Aisheng Dong's bug.

ok, thanks.

I wish to handle it at the board level.

But I have no idea how to solve the conflict between GPMI and SD.  :(

Could you give me some hint?
thanks

ok.
I will try to find some solution.

I can use the IRC too.
