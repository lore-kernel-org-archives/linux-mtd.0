Sorry, I overlooked that. But that code's pretty dumb. I'll take yours
as-is, but I'll send a patch to fix both.

OK, no problem.

Applied to l2-mtd.git, thanks!

BTW, is this driver worth a MAINTAINERS entry? It's nice to always have
someone on CC that has the hardware. The git history should probably
pick you up anyway when running get_maintainers.pl, so it may not be
absolutely necessary.

I'll see if I can dig these out of the mailing list eventually. I have a
sizable backlog.
