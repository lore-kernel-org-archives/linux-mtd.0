yes, for this question, I have done some testes, If I change the
PRGDATA3 to PRGDATA5 for mt8173_nor_set_read_mode() like others
functions, then the controller will be hanged, and I have asked our
designer for double confirm.

yes, I have used "rxlen -1", because the first of nor flash output is
located at SHREG[0], in the other words, the output data starts at
SHREG[0] and go up to SHREG[relen -1]

Yes, you are right! and I will adjust the boundary conditions in
do_tx_rx() function.

By the way, could you tell me whether I need to publish a new patch? or
you can fix them up directly?
