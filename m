mkfs.ubifs itself isn't needed as empty ubi volumes are formated when
mounting them with UBIFS.

I think it would make sense to add a check for ubiupdatevol to
_require_scratch_encryption (used in _scratch_mkfs_encrypted to
whipe an existing volume).

I can't really reproduce this on my end. Neither on my Debian test VM,
nor on the OpenSUSE system that I'm working on right now. I get no
output from blkid, neither before nor after mounting the ubi volume.

To be fair, the Debian version (and thus its blkid version) is rather
old (blkid 1.0.0 (12-Feb-2003)), but the one on OpenSUSE seems to be
fairly recent:

$ blkid -v
blkid from util-linux 2.28  (libblkid 2.28., 12-Apr-2016)


Would it make sense to patch the check in common/config instead,
to default to ubifs if FSTYP is not set and the target is a
character device? Or simply require on FSTYP to be set in the
config file?


Thanks,

David
