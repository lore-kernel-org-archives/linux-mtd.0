AFAICT JFFS2 checks the flash for areas that contain only FF and
treats them like erased flash. At least it tries to overwrite such
areas in flash without erasing it beforehand.
I avoided the problem by creating JFFS2 images that are padded with
oxff to page size only instead of eraseblock size.

"Your flasher" is the standard mtd-utils mkfs.jffs2 to create an image
file and the U-Boot commands 'nand erase/nand write' or
the mtd-utils 'flash_eraseall/nandwrite' to write it to flash.
