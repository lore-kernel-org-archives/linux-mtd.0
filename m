What we try to do here is to specify the hardware limitations. There
seem to be some hardware restrictions when it comes to clock
frequencies. There has been a rather long discussion over at Freescales
community about it:
https://community.freescale.com/thread/317074

Not sure if this is the right way to specify the supported frequencies,
or should we create a custom property for this, something like
fsl,max-nfc-frequency = <33000000>?

Yeah, looks like a platform_data leftover, will change that.

Hm, I never tried using this Driver without DT. I guess in practice, we
won't get here in a DT enabled kernel anyway: If there is no device tree
node with one of the drivers compatibility ids, the probe function won't
be called.

Theoretically, the IP supported by this driver is part of two other
SoC's which are supported by Linux: PowerPC MPC5125 (DT) and a ColdFire
MCF54418 (non-DT). So this driver might be used on a ColdFire SoC using
the platform support. Currently, one would just not have the ability to
set the hardware ECC options... I'm a bit reluctant to implement full
platform support without being able to properly test it. If anybody is
interested in it, one could easily extend the driver...

Put Geert in CC...
