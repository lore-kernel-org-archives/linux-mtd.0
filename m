I am already preparing a v2 based over Yunhui's series. :)

Actually, my needs could be met using Han Xu's dynamic LUT entries
without the need to introduce 'virtual' opcodes (and without having
to 'leak back' those new opcodes into other kernel code portions).

The per-slave differences (in my case, bus width essentially) can be
managed though DT entries and corresponding per-nor flags in the driver.

Noted -- I'll check that the driver always use the current NOR codes.

Understood and agreed.

Thanks for yuor feedback!

Good. I have another question about Yunhui's patch set. Who are in charge o=
f review
and merge code change in spi-nor.c? Some patches have been pending for a wh=
ile.
