Hi Miquèl,

This patchset already takes into account new framework modifications 
done by Boris (3rd batch of cleanups).

The select_chip hook is not used any more in this patchset and 
exec_op/setup_data_interface hooks have been moved to 
nand_controller_ops structure.

static const struct nand_controller_ops stm32_fmc2_nand_controller_ops = {
	.attach_chip = stm32_fmc2_attach_chip,
	.exec_op = stm32_fmc2_exec_op,
	.setup_data_interface = stm32_fmc2_setup_interface,
};

Regards,
Christophe Kerello.
