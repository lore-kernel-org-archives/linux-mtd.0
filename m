Xilinx GQSPI is a generic quad spi controller. The primary goal is to support
Generic/Future command sequences and Future NOR/NAND flash devices.
This core can also be used for legacy SPI devices. Due to the generic nature
of the core, software can generate any command sequence. It also has additional
features like parallel and stacked configurations to double the data
rate and size.
Accessing spi-nor flash device is one particular use case and like
that there will be
many. So, we decided to keep this driver in generic spi framework and
that is the ideal
thing to do for the GQSPI controller.
