Right, but that doesn't have an obvious mapping to SPI...

That's not quite the full story, these appear to be doing flash specific
things which depend on the partcular flash being interacted with and
which as a result aren't purely at the SPI level.  It's not clear if
this has some sort of generic meaning for flash or if it really is just
a controller specific implementation detail, nor is it clear what the
actual meaning of what the commands do is.

The biggest problem with most of this stuff has been poor abstractions
and application specific assumptions so I'd not want to just assume that
there isn't some broader meaning that's obvious in the flash context, it
seems fairly clear that the hardware is specifically targetted at flash
so generic flash concepts seem likely to appear in the hardware.

Also bear in mind that we need a respin at the big picture level here,
the patches have already been discarded.

I wouldn't assume that a quick scan is going to tell you what's going
on, nor that things have been explained clearly.
