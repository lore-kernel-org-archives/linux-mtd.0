Hi Brian,

a bit of investigation later I have some coherent answers to your
requests. :)

If I'm using the HWECC/DMA functions I have no way to check the OOB ECC
area. The controller just skips over it and only transfers user
available OOB data into the buffer. So checking the OOB is unfortunately
not easily done.

It's possible, but I've skipped it for now, as this would increase the
amount of testing I have to do to validate each round of those patches
even more and I don't see much benefit right now. So this remains a
TODO.

I agree with the reasoning here and made those changes for v4.
