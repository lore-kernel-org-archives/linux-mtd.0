My understanding is that, if a flash is Octal IO capable, then it
supports all mode of Octal IO (1-1-8, 1-8-8 and 8-8-8). At least in the
current code, I see SPI_NOR_QUAD_READ seems to imply 1-1-4, 1-4-4 and
4-4-4 modes.
Moreover, these capabilities should be auto discoverable once flash
start populating SFDP JESD216C tables (IIRC, JESD216B already takes care
of QUAD IO modes). So, I don't think we need different flags for 1-1-8,
1-8-8 and 8-8-8. Please let me if that's not the case.

For this patch, I wanted to start small and support only 1-1-8 mode
which is the easiest.

Hmm, it almost seems like Macronix flash warrants its own driver now.
