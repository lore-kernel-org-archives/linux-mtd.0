Sounds like 2 independent changes in one patch - please, split on 2
patches.

Sorry, but we have tons of NAND drivers, and if each driver will have a
config option for "BBT or scanning", our configuration menu will blow
up :-)

Really, it does not make sense to make this a config option - the BBT
should be detected automatically, and if it is present and correct -
scanning should not be done, otherwise, we should fall back to scanning.
And this should be a feature of the NAND base support. Please, look at
this and change the NAND base support if needed.

Sorry, but again, things like this should be automatically detected -
check the versions and some other magic ids and decide dynamically
whether to swap or not. If it is impossible, then this information
should be taken from the device tree (which does not exist yet, but
people are working on this).

In any case, the rule of thumb is to think twice before adding a kenel
config option - we have too many of them already.
