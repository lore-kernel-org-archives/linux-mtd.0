Another version of the Armada 370/XP SoCs v3 patchset, addressing
all the feedback provided by Brian Norris.

Please see Documentation/mtd/nand/pxa3xx-nand.txt for specific details
about the controller and the driver.

Just as the last version, the bad block factory initial detection issue
is not addressed by this patchset, but support for it will be added in
a near future once we decide the proper roadmap. See here the discussion
about it:

  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.mtd/49401

As usual patches 1-4, adding the clock infrastructure have already been merged
and will be dropped once this series can be based on v3.13-rc1.
I'm including them just for completeness.

Based in l2-mtd's master branch. Also, I've pushed a branch to our github
in case anyone wants to test it:

  https://github.com/MISL-EBU-System-SW/mainline-public/tree/l2-mtd/upstream-nand-v4

As per Jason Cooper's suggestion I'm Ccing devicetree mailing list, to get a review
on the small binding changes this patchset contains. If the devicetree people wants
us to just Cc you on the relevant patches, just let us know.

Of course, there's some room for improvements in this driver, and I'll probably
continue working on it. However, for now I'd like to focus in adding the strict
minimum amount of changes required to support the new SoC family and pospone any
improvements.

Thanks!

* Changes from v3 (feedback from Brian Norris)

  * Add binding documentation for the nand-flash-bbt DT property.

  * Expand in the documentation and in a comment the reason for
    setting the NAND_BBT_NO_OOB_BBM option.

  * Reworked the 'is_ready' completion handler. We still have
    two completions, but we've dropped the atomic_t type as
    now the variable is no longer accesed from interruption context.

  * Fixed the ecc.read_page() which lacked the max_bitflip return.

  * Reworked the ECC strength and size setting. This is important
    to allow the MTD layer to properly report on bitflip threshold
    situation.

  * Dropped an unused fifo_size state variable

  * Use '0' instead of the wrong '-1' when the extended command type
    doesn't matter or extended semantics are not supposed to be used.

* Changes from v2 (some minor fixes as per Huang's good feedback)

  * Add some more details to the commit log in patch
    "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Early variant detection"

  * Add an empty line between variable declaration and function body
    in patch "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Use chip->cmdfunc instead of the internal".

  * Fix a build break caused by incomplete variable replacement:
    "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Replace host->page_size by mtd->writesize"

* Changes from v1

Aside from several changes based in Brian's feedback, the main changes
from v1 are:

  * The controller's clock source is now fully modeled, see patche 1 to 4.
    Of course, none of those patches should be taken through the mtd
    subsystem, but I'm adding them here for completeness.

  * The chip's cmdfunc() is now independently implemented in each SoC variant.
    The rationale behind this decision is that 'chunked' I/O is the only tested
    mode on the Armada370 variant, while the old 'vanilla' I/O is the only
    tested mode on the PXA variant.

    So it's safer to have an implementation for each variant.

  * Added support for BCH-8, in other words: 8-bits of correction in a 512-byte
    region. This is obtained by using a data chunk size of 1024B, thus doubling
    the ECC BCH strength, as per this ECC engine mechanism.

  * The ECC layout in use, which must be set according to the page size and
    desired ECC strength is now strictly chosen to match only the tested
    combinations.
