Right. Probably '0' is a saner value.

Right, I'll add a zero-valued default.

OK.

Yes, probably. The rationale behind these xxx_ecc_init() functions is
to only validate the devices I've tested or that are known to work.

That said, maybe I'm being too paranoid.

Not for the time being. (Are there any new non-ONFI NAND devices?)

Given this series is already long and complex, I'd like to push as much
features as possible to follow-up patches. That way we can support the
current boards out there now (Mirabox's a relevant example) and add support
for more later, gradually.

Yes, and I tried to answer your questions in detail in the cover letters
(which now is in a patch for Documentation/mtd/nand/...) and in past
discussion.

See for instance: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.mtd/48895.

Feel free to ask any further clarification about how the ECC engine
works. If you think it'll help, I can write a separate mail describing
it (to the best of my knowledge) and we can discuss there.

In particular, the above link contains a question that is still
unanswered and that would help me understand this better.
I'll copy-paste it here:

"""
Regarding this: I'd really like to understand better this 'step' concept
and it applicability on this controller. So any clarification is welcome
:)

As far as I can see: currently the hardware does ECC corrections in a
completely transparent fashion and merely 'reports' the no. of corrected
bits through some IRQ plus some registers.
Therefore, it implements the ecc.{read,write}_page() functions.

So, why should I tell the NAND core any of the ECC details?

I see other drivers need to implement some of the functions in the
nand_ecc_ctrl struct, such as: hwctl(), calculate() or correct().
However, I can't see how any of that applies on this controller.
"""

Thanks a lot for reviewing all of this!
