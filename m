Do you mean the uboot may write something to the NAND?
Could you show me some more detail cases?

The NAND_BBT_NO_OOB makes the BBT written to the NAND with the ECC enabled.

The kobs-ng which burns the bootloader to the NAND will also burn the
whole BBT
to the NAND too.

So I think the bootloader and the kernel share the same BBT information.

But if the bootloader can make some block bad, the BBT information
becomes different.
Does the bootloader have the feature to make some block bad?
