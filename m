I don't know that much about this hardware, but it's not clear whether
you properly addressed Russell's comment about the sharing of the VPP
control. The reference counting is done on a per-flash basis, so it
doesn't actually handle multiple flash correctly AFAICT. I also don't
know if (like Russell mentioned) this is practically important to
anything besides just phymap/NOR flash, or if there are other flash
types used in practice (if so, then this series is insufficient).

Regarding your prior questions about this driver: I don't really have
much direction for the driver, as I simply inherited it and have barely
touched it. As your series still looks like a reasonable restructuring,
and it isn't a regression from any existing support:

I don't personally care where the PULL goes.
