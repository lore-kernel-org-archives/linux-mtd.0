I don't recall seeing these comments, so yes, I think they were
missed.  Will fix.

I think with the comment there, it's perfectly clear what's happening.

How do you obtain these timings?  I don't see tBER or tPROG being used
anywhere in MTD.

I'm not sure, no.  If I change it, how will I know if it's still doing
the correct thing or otherwise?

Yourself and Brian seem to disagree on this point.  Which is correct?

... here is the converse argument.

On closer inspection it appears that drvdata was already in use.  I've
not encompassed the NANDi information and the old pdata into one ddata
container.

It's a bit late for v3.17 now, but let's see what we can do about
getting it in for v3.18.  Fingers crossed!

Right.
