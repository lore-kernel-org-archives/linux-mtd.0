I don't think that's a problem. Masahiro's changes are targeting 4.19,
so these new DT changes should go in after that anyway.

Just because the DT changes you made fixed the problem doesn't mean it's
the right solution. DT should represent HW blocks and HW connections.
According to Masahiro, the denali NAND controller takes 3 clk signals
in input, so those 3 clks should be represented in the DT with 3
entries in the "clocks" and "clock-names" props. The fact that, in the
socfpga case, all clk input signals are actually connected to the same
clk provider does not mean you should have a single entry in "clocks"
and "clock-names". Instead, you should have all 3 entries of clocks
pointing to the same clk provider.
