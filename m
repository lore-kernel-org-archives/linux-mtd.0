Here are some old results with a very simple configuration:
=
http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/old-results/4.4.0-v7r11/
=
http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/old-results/3.14.0-v7r3/
=
http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/old-results/3.13.0-v7r2/

Then I stopped repeating tests that always yielded the same good =
results.

As for more professional systems, a well-known company doing
real-time packet-traffic dumping asked me to modify bfq so as to
guarantee lossless data writing also during queries.  The involved box
had a RAID reaching a few Gbps, and everything worked well.

Anyway, if you have specific issues in mind, I can check more deeply.

Thanks,
Paolo
