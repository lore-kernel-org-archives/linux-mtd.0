Sorry I don't get it...
You gave a pseudo DT example in your following answers but I still
don't understand how you'll link the NFC and its associated NAND chips.

This nand node contains nand chip nodes, so 'nand' is definitely not
the appropriate name for this node.
We could name it SMC, but I'd like to keep EBI (External Bus
Interface), because the only thing that can register child devices in
linux are busses (or MFD devices :-)).
The SMC (Static Memory Controller) is just a additional control logic
acting on top of the EBI.

But all NAND chips will have to point to the same nfc struct, and I'd
rather represent the NFC IP in the DT than hide it into the driver's
logic.
Moreover, the NFC IP is not part of the EBI memory range, so I'd prefer
to keep it outside of the EBI node (though I'm not sure you're trying to
represent the EBI bus here).

Could you give a real DT example instead of a pseudo DT representation,
maybe I'll understand what you're suggesting then.

Well, that's more someting like:

ebi@xxxx {
	pinctrl-0 = <&ebi_data_bus_pins &ebi_addr_bus_pins
		     &ebi_nand_cs0_pin &ebi_nand_rb0_pin ...>;

	nand@0,xxxx {
		/* ../ */
	};

	nand@1,xxxx {
		/* ../ */
	}
}

Okay, I guess I understand what you were talking about in your previous
suggestion, and I'm not a big fan of this representation.

The SMC IP provides a set of registers to configure external devices
timings (and other related stuff).
Here you're representing NAND chip devices under the SMC node, which is
not exactly how I would represent them.
The IP controlling the available NAND chips is actually the NFC (NAND
Flash Controller).
How about this representation instead ?

nfc@xxxxx {
	nand-chips = <&nand0 &nand1>;
}

Josh, could you rework your proposal with a real DT representation so
that I'll be sure to understand what you're suggesting ?

Thanks.

Best Regards,

Boris
