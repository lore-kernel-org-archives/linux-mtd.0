Just because it's currently nicer to put partitions in device tree
doesn't really mean it's good to extend those bindings to do even more.
I believe there are alternatives that could work just fine. See below.

I haven't followed the entire thread, though I've skimmed most of it,
and I agree I don't see a good reason for UBI DT bindings.

I disagree. How is the situation different?

To be clear, I'd really like to avoid relying on and extending fixed
partitioning like defined in Documentation/.../mtd/partitions.txt. So
anything we can do to help you plan for not relying on that case would
be awesome. For instance, with this series, there will hopefully be more
cases where you don't need your whole partition layout in DT:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2015-December/064076.html

So what will you do then?

Also, why are you relying on the index form of ubi.mtd=X (e.g.,
ubi.mtd=0)? Why can't you use ubi.mtd=rootfs (and define 'label =
"rootfs"' with the existing fixed-partition DT bindings)?

http://linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html#L_attachmtd

That seems less likely to break, and it could probably be adapted/reused
on systems where you might not put the entire partition layout in device
tree. (i.e., you don't have to reinvent your wheel if you start using
non-"fixed-partitions" device trees.)

I agree that those two concepts have a quite different likelihood of
being accepted (the former is possible; the latter seems highly
suspect).
