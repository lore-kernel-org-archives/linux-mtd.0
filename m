Ah, my mistake. So the brcmnand_read_fc() has to just keep using __raw_readl
here, unlike the other accessors that should (on non-MIPS) use readl_relaxed
or readl.

Yes, I was misreading the code and missed the fact that you implement
a memcpy, not read-from-fifo in that loop. For the fifo case, the
optimized implementation is in arch/arm/lib/io-readsl.S, while you
are right that the ARM implementation of memcpy_fromio is pessimal
by doing byte sized accesses, so don't use that. Your loop is fine.

Yes, we've had actual bugs in the past where it broke from one gcc
release to the next. The reason it broke there was that the pointer
was assigned (in violation of the C standard) from a pointer of smaller
alignment. If you have code that does:


	char __iomem *p1 = ...;
	void __iomem *p2 = p1;
	int __iomem *p3 = p2;
	u32 data = __raw_readl(p3);

then gcc may decide that it is not safe to do 32-bit aligned accesses
because it does not know the alignment of p1.
