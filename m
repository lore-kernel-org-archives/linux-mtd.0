Gabriel,

I haven't compared Dove NFC with the one from PXA3xx or Armada 370/XP
in detail, yet. I doubt that it will be fully compatible with Armada
370/XP as you state it is NFCv2 above.

We'll deal with it as soon as the i2c-mux thing is worked out.

#address-cells and #size-cells of &nand below is <1> each, so above
should be 32b values. If it would be 64b it would have to be split
into two 32b values anyway.

Please avoid adding extra whitespaces.

As said above, I doubt Dove NFC is fully compatible with Armada 370 NFC.
Ezequiel can tell for sure, as he probably knows Marvell NFC best.

There is a clock gate for NFC, check Dove FS, Clock Gating Control
register, bit 10. Above should be:

	clocks = <&gate_clk 10>;

I haven't checked the foo-arbiter property, but are you sure it is
available on Dove?
