Right. Well, for now I would just add a pr_warn("Your device is not
supported. Please ask Ezequiel to add it") or something along those
lines.

BTW: So, I guess that for non-ONFI devices we must simply put the ECC
information in the DT (being a hardware parameter)?

Having followed (part) of the OMAP DT ECC discussion, I'm thinking:
wouldn't it be good to have an 'nand-ecc-strength' property in the DT?

It would match the ecc_strength_ds field. This way, the ECC mode
selection is left to the driver and not to the user.
On the other side, this can cause some severe incompatibilities
unless such driver *always* make the *same* selection.

Anyway, none of this matters in this patchset, for the time being.

Indeed, 16-over-2048 is stronger than 4-over-512 :)

Hm.. I see. Well, it's just a matter of returning the corrected bits,
which are already obtained. Furthermore, one of the last patches in
this series, namely:

"mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Add ECC BCH correctable errors detection"

Takes care of obtaining the proper corrected bits number.

(Let me paste here your other reply to this same mail)

"""

So, if I understand correctly and assuming the controller works as the
specification says (sorry, it's not public yet) I think the 'step' is
the chunk size and the strength is 16 bytes:

	/* In BCH mode */
	ecc->size = chunk->size;
	ecc->strength = 16;

And maybe I could try to expand some more the ECC description in the
Documentation/mtd/nand/pxa3xx-nand.txt.
