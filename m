I don't see where the problem is. The fact that bad block marker are 
used or not, is not related to "my" patch. This patch just places data 
where they should be. If I take the Nand and connect it to a not-bugged 
NFC controller, all data will be read correctly with data is main area 
and OOB is spare area.

Now I want to adapt and publish my platform file to latest kernel 
version and I am still stopped with this biswap patch that is not 
applied. As I said before, I must not be the only that have used this 
damned original patch from Freescale that swaps byte in their ATK 
programming soft, redboot and Kernel and it is impossible to fallback to 
current NAND handling (without swapping).

Is there any chance that if I send this patch against linux-next/master 
branch, it will be finally accepted. Only people that needs it will use 
it. There is so much option in menuconfig with so little explaination 
and mark as "Only say Yes if you known what you do".
