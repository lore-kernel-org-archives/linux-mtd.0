The problem with using a stream cipher --- whether that is ChaCha20, AES-CTR, or
something else --- for disk/file encryption is that by necessity of file/disk
encryption, each time the "same" block is written to, the IV is the same, which
is really bad for stream ciphers (but not as bad for AES-XTS, AES-CBC, etc.).
It's irrelevant whether you do ESSIV or otherwise encrypt the IVs.  ESSIV does
make the IV for each offset unpredictable by an attacker, which is desirable for
AES-CBC, but it doesn't stop the IV from being repeated for each overwrite.

And just to clarify, you definitely *can* seek to any position in the ChaCha20
stream using the existing ChaCha20 implementations and the existing skcipher
API, simply by providing the appropriate IV.  Maybe it was unintentional, but it
does work.  chacha20poly1305.c even uses it to start at block 1 instead of block
0.  I don't know whether there are other users, though.
