This is correct, except some chips (that's true at least for ONFI
compatible ones) allow dynamic configuration of timings, and each die
can be configured in a different timing mode.

That's what's happening when you reset dies. They will automatically
enter timing mode 0 (the slowest mode), and you have to explicitly set
them back to timing mode X (the fastest supported mode). While doing
that, you'll have some of your dies configured in timing 0, while
others have already been switched to timing mode X, and that's the main
reason for having per-die timing configuration.
