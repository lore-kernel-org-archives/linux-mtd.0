Well, I assume you mean the t_encrypted_d_revalidate portion of the test.
generic/429 will still fail overall if you remove fscrypt_set_d_op() --- which
is expected, since it's testing dentry revalidation after all.

The test is repeatedly creating and removing a directory "dir" while lookups are
being done in it.  It seems the problem is that many dentries are being created
for "dir", and they pin many different inodes, all at the same time.  This
actually happens for ext4 too; it just doesn't cause an observable error.

I doubt it's the right solution to make fscrypt_d_revalidate() look at
->i_nlink, since ->d_revalidate() is meant to validate the filename, not the
inode.  I think there is probably a VFS bug that is causing the dentries to not
be freed.
