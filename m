Deferred probing cannot be used with platform_driver_probe as by the
time probing is retried either the driver has been unregistered or its
probe function has been set to platform_drv_probe_fail.

With commit e9354576 ("gpiolib: Defer failed gpio requests by default")
the gpio subsystem started returning -EPROBE_DEFER, which in turn
several platform drivers using platform_driver_probe return to driver
core. Other subsystems (e.g. regulator) has since started doing the
same.

The first patch in this series prevents platform drivers using
platform_driver_probe from requesting probe deferral while warning that
it is not supported.

The remaining patches move six platform-driver probe functions that rely
on gpio_request out of __init. There are likely other probe functions
that might return -EPROBE_DEFER and should be moved out of __init as
well.

Note that the mvsdio, at91_cf and pxa25x_udc patches are completely
untested.
