Yes, that's what it looks like. Note that this output is on first boot
after flashing the device (with the UBI auto-grow option). I guess UBI
is reading all pages once to verify that they are empty.

I did not know that issue 2 exists. How can 2 happen on a erased page?
With a 'stuck at zero' in OOB?

I assumed that your code assumes that the controller returns the flipped
bit count when reading an erase page (case 1), which I did not found in
the documentation.

Yes, we are using Macronix SLC NAND.

This is a new device, but its one out of several dozens. The device had
two factory marked bad page. This four page would then be 6 bad pages. I
would say that your guess is probably the case at hand (should be
considered bad, but were marked by factory).

A quick search through 3.17-rc3 didn't found that string.

I will read the pages using raw again and check how many bit flips it
shows. But I guess regarding Brian's comment to 3b, the driver actually
behaves correct and return -1, because we have bit flips on erased page
which is not good...

UBI starts to scrub & torture those 4 pages then, but starts doing this
with other pages too. All the pages start to fail then! I'm still
investigating that issue.
