First let me clarify one point. This series focuses on Spansion, Macronix
and Micron because when I wrote its patches few months ago, the spi-nor.c
driver supported QSPI protocols only for these three only manufacturers.
Today I notice that now some Winbond memories also use the
SPI_NOR_QUAD_READ flag. Though I try to deal with all manufacturers on a
equal foot, I currently have no knowledge on Windond memories so my
explanations only apply to Spansion, Macronix and Micron memories.

About the SPI 4-4-4 protocol, it is only supported by Micron and Macronix
memories but not by Spansion. Both Micron and Macronix memories provide us
with a special mode, let's call it the Quad SPI mode. As Bean Huo explained
for Micron, once this mode is enabled, the memory expects all commands to
use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol. Hence even if the spi-nor.c driver uses the Fast
Read Quad Output 1-1-4 (0x6b/0x6c) or the Fast Read Quad I/O 1-4-4 (0xeb/0xec)
op codes, the command is interpreted as a Fast Read Quad Command 4-4-4 so must
use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol. As far as I know, there is no currently existing
op code dedicated to the Fast Read Quad Command 4-4-4.

So the op codes may be confusing but when the Quad SPI mode is enabled we
actually use Fast Read 4-4-4 commands.

I did not run comparative tests between Fast Read 1-1-4, Fast Read 1-4-4
and Fast Read 4-4-4 yet. Honestly I don't expect much difference. However
performances were not the main purpose when I wrote these patches.
Actually the Quad SPI mode of Macronix and Micron comes with a side effect.
Once enable, not only the memory now expects all commands to use the
SPI 4-4-4 protocol but it no longer replies to the regular Read JEDEC ID
command (0x9f). Instead it replies to a new command, the Read JEDEC ID
Multiple I/O (0xaf).
Now let's imagine that the Quad SPI mode is either permanently enabled at
reset using non-volatile configuration registers or enabled by a early
bootloader. When the spi-nor driver tries to probe the memory, the 0x9f
command fails: the driver should adapt, that's why it tries other protocols
such as SPI 4-4-4 (Micron and Macronix) and SPI 2-2-2 (Micron only when in
Dual SPI mode) with the 0xaf command. When we finally get a valid JEDEC ID,
we also know the current mode of memory.

Then the global policy of this series of patches is:
1 - try to configure the QSPI memory as asked by the user, ie according to
    the read_mode argument of spi_nor_scan().
2 - use volatile bits in configuration registers as much as possible, try to
    avoid changing non-volatile bits hence bootloaders should drive the
    QSPI memory always in the same state after reset.
3 - check the current state/mode the the QSPI memory and adapt to it in order
    to limit the configuration changes
4 - try not to introduce regression ;)

For instance with Micron memories, about the choice between the Extended
SPI mode and the Quad SPI mode, I've currently chosen to keep on using the
detected mode during the probing phase (Read JEDED ID).
Indeed the Extended SPI mode does support the Fast Read 1-1-4 command,
which should not be very different from Fast Read x-4-4 commands thinking
about performances. So I thought it was safer not to change the mode rather
than forcing the Quad SPI mode. Actually using Fast Read 1-1-4 in Extended 
SPI mode only requires the SPI_RX_QUAD capability from the SPI controller
whereas the Quad SPI mode would also require the SPI_TX_QUAD capability.
Referring to the m25p80 driver, the mode argument of spi_nor_scan() is set
to SPI_NOR_QUAD if and only if the SPI controller has the SPI_RX_QUAD flag.
That's not enough to know whether the SPI controller could support to
enable the Quad SPI mode of the Micron memory.
However, if the Quad SPI mode was already enabled and the spi-nor driver
succeeded in probing the Micron memory with the 0xaf command in SPI 4-4-4
protocol, we know that the SPI controller does support the SPI 4-4-4
protocol then we can safely leave the Quad SPI mode of the Micron memory
enabled. Same thing with Micron Dual SPI mode ant the support of the
SPI 2-2-2 protocol by the SPI controller.


Here is my understanding of the volatile/non-volatile bits in
the configuration registers for each QSPI manufacturer according to their
datasheets. Please note that some manufacturers such as Micron provide
both volatile and non-volatile registers to configure some settings.

                       Micron             Macronix           Spansion
Quad/Dual SPI Mode     volatile capable   persistent only    persistent only

# of dummy cycles      volatile capable   volatile capable   persistent only


I think the only place where I may change a non-volatile bit is in
spansion_set_quad_mode() when setting the QUAD bit in the Configuration
Register 1 (CR1) if the user asked to use a Quad SPI protocol but the QUAD
bit was not set yet. That's why I added a dev_warn() message.

About the number of dummy cycles, the spi-nor framework adapts to the current
setting of a Spansion memory.

I want to be totally honest on this point: I did NOT test with Macronix
memories yet simply because I have no such memory from this manufacturer.
I guess Atmel planed to purchase some samples because we also need to test
their support in the sama5d2 romcode when booting from QSPI.
So for the Macronix case, the patches are only based on my current
understanding of Macronix datasheets (MX66L1G45G, 3V, 1Gb, v1.0.pdf).

On the other hand I did many tests with both Micron and Spansion memories
with sama5d2 SoCs, either with Linux or with the sama5d2 romcode ("normal"
Fast Read x-y-4 but also eXecution In Place using the Continuous Read mode:
the XIP mode is not relevant for the Linux spi-nor framework but it should
take care of the "dummy cycles" it sends to avoid entering into the
Continuous Read mode by mistake).
I used at least these memories under Linux:
- Micron n25q128a13: sama5d2 xplained ultra + linux-next 20151207 /
  at91 linux 4.1
- Micron n25q256: sama5d2 prototype (FPGA) + at91 linux 3.18
- Spansion s25fl512: sama5d2 prototype (FPGA) + at91 linux 3.18

Maybe Marek also did some tests on his side.
