A good example why "luck" might not be far away from the truth is what 
happens when a drivers moves e.g. from staging to it's real position. 
Also the position will stay inside the same initcall level, the move of 
the driver into another directory (maybe together with a rename) will 
likely change its position in the initcall-sequence, without anyone 
really expecting this.

Lazy was the wrong term. It is time consuming, cumbersome and therefor 
error-prone to check on what other stuff a driver depends. One reason 
why choosing the right place in the initcall sequence isn't that easy 
and why some automation make sense.
