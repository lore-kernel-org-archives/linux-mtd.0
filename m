It wouldn't be bad to add this kind of explanation to the commit =
message, so
that it is clear why simple zeroing of the partial block doesn't work.

While it is true that the crypto xattr _could_ exist in the external =
xattr block,
this is fairly unlikely since this xattr is created first, so it is most =
likely
to be in the inode xattr space.  Also, it is common that there is no =
external
xattr block.  In most cases, setting the xattr with the same size will =
overwrite
it in-place rather than try to allocate new space for it, so this should =
be
relatively easy to implement.

In the end, trying to zero this xattr and failing is no worse than not =
doing it
at all, so I think it reasonable to try.  It shouldn't result in any =
extra I/O,
since the inode always needs to be written out anyway to store the dtime =
and
nlink =3D 0.

Cheers, Andreas
