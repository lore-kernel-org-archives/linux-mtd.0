You could use it for the standard chips where you do not need
additional information. That way most NAND chips could be supported
out of the box without having to modify the driver.

Do we really need exact timing data for each individual chip?
Or couldn't we live with some sane timing that works for most chips
and provide some means to specify a different timing via
platform_data?

Why can't you just create appropriate partitions using the standard
partition handlers?
