Just looking into this now. Can I add support for a vendor specific
signature extension? ST's flashers, bootloaders and tooling currently
use the format:

/* Extend IBBT header with some stm-nand-bch niceties */
struct nand_ibbt_bch_header {
	uint8_t signature[4];           /* "Bbt0" or "1tbB" signature */
	uint8_t version;                /* BBT version ("age") */
	uint8_t reserved[3];            /* padding */
	uint8_t baseschema[4];          /* "base" schema (x4) */
	uint8_t privschema[4];          /* "private" schema (x4) */
	uint8_t ecc_size[4];            /* ECC bytes (0, 32, 54) (x4) */
	char    author[64];             /* Arbitrary string for S/W to use */
}; __attribute__((__packed__))

It would be great if we can support this with a descriptor option or
suchlike, as it would a) save me a lot of aggravation and b) continue
to support ST with their current use-case.
