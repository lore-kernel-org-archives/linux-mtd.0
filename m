This is the correct way to limit the fix to the correct versions of the
nand controller, but that's not what I tried to say. You might want
to use solution (2) for your board whereas I want to use solution (3)
for my boards. With the Kconfig approach it would not be possible for
us to use the same kernel binary.

s/imx51/imx31/.

Yes, only imx27 and imx31 a affected by this bug.
