Out of curiosity, if an encrypted block is zero-filled at the end when
the key is unavailable, what would happen?  At worst this would result
in garbage at the end of the file when the zeroes are "decrypted"?

Is it possible to unlink files if they are encrypted without the key (if
the user has permission to write to the directory)?

Does file unlink result in the per-file crypto key being erased in the
inode, or is the inode just marked unused but not overwritten?  One of
the desirable features of per-file crypto is "secure erase" so that once
the inode is unlinked the crypto key is gone and there is no way to =
decrypt
the data after the fact, even if the filesystem/user key is later =
recovered.
If the per-file key is still sitting in the inode, then it may be =
possible
to decrypt the data long after the file was deleted if the key is later
compromised and the inode+data blocks were not re-used.

Cheers, Andreas
