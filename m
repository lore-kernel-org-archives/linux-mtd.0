Sigh, is how to do compatibles really not yet understood?

This. And no wildcards in the compatible string.

I wouldn't object to this from a DT perspective as I have no clue 
generally if IP blocks are "the same" or not. Subsystem maintainers will 
object though.

They are both future-proof. #2 has the disadvantage of requiring a 
kernel update for a new SoC.
