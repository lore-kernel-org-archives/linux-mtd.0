I first did simple raw read and write of a kernel image, which worked
fine:

Then, I tried and mount the jffs2 partition. This failed with some
errors:

At that point, I though the jffs2 partition was somewhat broken
on my RN102 from previous tests so I decided and try to flash on
it a recovery jffs2 dump I had:


root@mood:~# nandwrite -p /dev/mtd4 /tmp/mtd4ro

And then trying to mount the fs (I guess I should have mounted it RO,
but I don't even know if it would have prevent the bad block table to
be filled)

jffs2: marking eraseblock at 046c0000 as bad

I hope the error messages produced during the session will somehow help
find were the issue comes from. I somewhat suspects some chip delay or
CRC issue (those errors appear above).

Well, I guess the bad block the driver put in the bbt are not that bad
in practice, i.e. they were mistakenly marked that way. I also
guess^Whope there is a some low level command I could use to simply
clear the bbt (the NAND had no bad block prior to the test). Any help
would be appreciated on that point.

Anyway, I have somehow decided to delay the test on my RN2120 (dual-core)
for now ;-)

Cheers,

a+
