Hello Yixun, Hello Liang,

I have a few small comments inline below
additionally I tried to explain the reason behind
"amlogic,mmc-syscon", clkin0 and clkin1 so Rob (or the devicetree
maintainers in general) can give feedback. feel free to correct me
wherever I'm wrong or provide additional notes in case I missed
something!

the patch description states that GXBB/GXL/AXG are supported
shouldn't you add a compatible string for GXBB as well?

to give the devicetree maintainers some context on clkin0 and clkin1:

older SoCs (Meson8, Meson8b - not supported by this binding/driver
yet) had a dedicated NAND clock. there neither clkin0 or clkin1 would
be used, instead we just had a "nand" or "interface" clock (I'm not
aware of the actual naming in Amlogic's internal datasheets)

newer SoCs do NOT have a dedicated NAND "interface" clock anymore.
instead they are sharing the clock with the "sd_emmc_c" controller (I
*believe* the reason for this is because sd_emmc_c and the NAND
controller use the same pads on the SoC, pinctrl muxing controls where
these pads are routed -> NAND and sd_emmc_c cannot be used at the same
time, so SoC designers probably decided to re-use the clock)

unfortunately the sd_emmc_c clock is not provided by the "main" clock
controller on these newer SoCs
instead the clock is part of the MMC controller's register space (see
the SD_EMMC_CLOCK register in drivers/mmc/host/meson-gx-mmc.c)
even worse: the SD_EMMC_CLOCK contains more than just clock settings
(bit 25 enables the SDIO interrupt, which is currently not supported
by the meson-gx-mmc driver though)

the SD_EMMC_CLOCK register has a mux (CLK_SRC_MASK) to choose from
clkin0 and clkin1 which are passed here
the "amlogic,mmc-syscon" property is used to get a phandle to the
sd_emmc_c syscon register space
thus there is a bit of code duplication in the MMC and NAND drivers
with this binding (because both need to configure the SD_EMMC_CLOCK
register)

as far as I know vendor specific properties should follow the naming
schema "vendor,purpose"
in this case this would be "amlogic,nand-user-mode"

maybe Rob can comment on this?

I assume 0 and 1 are the only possible values.
to use of_property_read_bool in the driver the property would be either:
- (absent) = scrambler is disabled
- amlogic,nand-enable-scrambler (without any value - also same comment
as above for the value) = scrambler is enabled
