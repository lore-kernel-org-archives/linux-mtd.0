OK, sounds reasonable.
Another simple strategy could use the fact that you add a 14th zero byte to
the 13 BCH bytes for RBL compatibility:

Upon reading:
 - if this 14th byte is zero (*) => page was programmed: perform ECC
   correction as usual
 - else, page was not programmed: do not perform ECC, read entire data+spare
   area, and set it to 0xff if less than 8 or 4 (max bitflips) zero bits
   were found

(*) for robustness to bitflip in 14th byte, replace condition
"14th byte is zero" by e.g. "14th byte has less than 4 bits set to 1".

What do you think ?
