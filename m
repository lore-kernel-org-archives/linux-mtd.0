I understand but you propose to patch both the SPI layer and the m25p80 driver
to introduce some support which is already provided by the "spi_flash_read"
hook: struct spi_flash_read_message has already a "dummy_bytes" field.
IMHO, it looks redundant.

If you really want to use something close to the "transfer_one" hook, I guess
you could build spi_transfer structures from the content of the struct
spi_flash_read_message argument of spi_flash_read() then pass those
spi_transfer structures to your custom "transfer_one_ex":

int transfer_one_ex(struct spi_master *master, struct spi_device *spi,
		    struct spi_transfer *transfer, u32 dummy_cycles);

You just need to set dummy_cycles to 0 to implement the regular "transfer_one"
hook.

Best regards,

Cyrille
