As already stated for v1, this makes perfect sense to me, thanks for posting it!

I do understand there is some pushback from Bart and Jens, around how
to move this forward. However, let's hope they get convinced to try
this out.

When it comes to potential "performance" regressions, I am sure Paolo
is standing-by to help out with BFQ changes, if needed. Moreover, we
can always do a simple revert in worst case scenario, especially since
the change is really limited.

So FWIW:
