Whats wrong with this simple hierarchy?

1. Block core selects the default scheduler.
2. Driver can overrule it early.
3. Userspace can overrule the default later.

Everyone is happy.

Good defaults in block core are great. Those defaults + #3 may cover
99% of the population.

1% of the population can use #2. See, Linus wants "bfq" for ubiblock.
Why wouldn't we to let him work with UBI community, show that bfq is 
best for ubiblock, and just let the UBI community overrule the block
core's default.

If some day in the future there is a very good reason, we can even make
this to be a module parameter, and people could just boot with
'ubiblock.iosched=bfq'.
