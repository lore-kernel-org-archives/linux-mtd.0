You are right, that clock gate was turned on, and it allowed access to
the APBH DMA.

However, while the gate was enabled, disabling the NAND_CLK_ROOT still
allowed to access APBH DMA, so the clock root itself is really not
required, but the gate is...

The clock which is required is NAND_USDHC_BUS_CLK_ROOT, but the gate is
part of NAND_CLK_ROOT. The clock tree is wrong: The gate is actually
shared, both clocks use the same gate.

In fact, assigning NAND_USDHC_BUS_CLK_ROOT directly to peripherals is
wrong since the gate is between the root clock and the peripherals (see
Figure 5-13 in RM). If we add the shared gate to NAND_USDHC_BUS_CLK_ROOT
directly, it will get enabled when using SDHC instances (since that root
clock is assigned to the sdhc instances, see
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9674281/)

How about introducing NAND_USDHC_BUS_CLK_RAWNAND/NAND_CLK_RAWNAND which
has the shared gate in between?
