Hello Ranjit:

> What is dual parallel mode?
> ---------------------------
> ZynqMP GQSPI controller supports Dual Parallel mode with following 
> functionalities:
> 1) Supporting two SPI flash memories operating in parallel. 8 I/O lines.
> 2) Chip selects and clock are shared to both the flash devices
> 3) This mode is targeted for faster read/write speed and also doubles 
the size
> 4) Commands/data can be transmitted/received from both the 
devices(mirror),
>    or only upper or only lower flash memory devices.
> 5) Data arrangement:
>    With stripe enabled,
>    Even bytes i.e. 0, 2, 4,... are transmitted on Lower Data Bus
>    Odd bytes i.e. 1, 3, 5,.. are transmitted on Upper Data Bus.

In the dual-parallel configuration, odd and even _bits_ of each byte are 
distributed over the flash chips; I am assuming this works just as in Zynq 
QSPI (apparently, the TRM for ZynqMP isn't out yet).

Striping seems to be a different mechanism, though. Can you explain it a 
bit more? Also, the wording seems to indicate that it belongs to 
dual-stacked rather than dual-parallel.

> 4) May also need to update read_fsr() to get status of both flashes
> 5) Adjustment of offset value based on the parallel/stacked mode 
configuration
> 6) Setting either parallel or stacked mode during the scan process.
> 7) In case of stacked mode, is there a MTD concatenation support?

In addition to 5), the MTD driver using a dual-parallel QSPI flash has to
5a) add padding at the start of data for unaligned addresses,
5b) add padding at the end of data for unaligned lengths.

Best regards,
