Hmmm, again, JFFS2 simply "writes" to an erased block. You say "it tries to
overwrite", but that's only because you programmed an empty page in the first
place! And it cannot "erase such areas beforehand" (think of a partially
programmed block with tailing empty pages).

Good.

OK, maybe you could submit a patch to fix this issue then ?
Thanks,
