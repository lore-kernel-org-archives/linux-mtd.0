While I agree that the number of skipped bytes is not a parameter of
the Denali IP, I also fear letting the opportunity to the user to use
random values in the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES registers (and have to
support them). I would also prefer a per-compatible value which is not
a perfect solution neither.
