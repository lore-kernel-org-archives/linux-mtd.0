Well, the problem with this is that big distro people really don't care
much because they already use udev for tuning the IO scheduler. So whatever
defaults the kernel is going to pick likely won't be seen by distro
customers. Embedded people seem to be driving this effort because they
either don't run udev or they feel not all their teams building new
products have enough expertise to come up with a proper set of rules...
