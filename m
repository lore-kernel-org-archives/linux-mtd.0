Then how do you want to name the near field communication drivers?

It would save more lines if you introduce the macros globally and
convert all existing resource definitions ;-)

Making code shorter is usually a good idea, but not when it conflicts
with readability. Adding custom macros that do string concatenation
is such a case.

As a rule, you should never introduce infrastructure just because you might
need it in the future but don't know if you will really need it.

This is even more important for the actual driver, as I mentioned in my other
mail. You have a hardware abstraction layer, but only one variant of the hardware
posted along with the driver. Without seeing different hardware, how should
anyone be able to tell whether the abstraction is really needed or if it's the
correct abstraction?
