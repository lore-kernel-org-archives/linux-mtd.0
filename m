I still don't like this. There are going to be tons of
cases where the single queue device is some hw raid setup
or similar, where performance is going to be much worse with
BFQ than it is with mq-deadline, for instance. That's just
one case.

This kind of policy does not belong in the kernel, at least
not in the current form. If we had some sort of "enable best
options for a desktop" then it could fall under that umbrella.
