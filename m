* Changes from v4

  * Rebased on top of l2-mtd.git origin/next branch

  * Fixed is_ready flag reset, renamed by a more descriptive
    and readble "need_wait".

* Changes from v3 (feedback from Brian Norris)

  * Add binding documentation for the nand-flash-bbt DT property.

  * Expand in the documentation and in a comment the reason for
    setting the NAND_BBT_NO_OOB_BBM option.

  * Reworked the 'is_ready' completion handler. We still have
    two completions, but we've dropped the atomic_t type as
    now the variable is no longer accesed from interruption context.

  * Fixed the ecc.read_page() which lacked the max_bitflip return.

  * Reworked the ECC strength and size setting. This is important
    to allow the MTD layer to properly report on bitflip threshold
    situation.

  * Dropped an unused fifo_size state variable

  * Use '0' instead of the wrong '-1' when the extended command type
    doesn't matter or extended semantics are not supposed to be used.

* Changes from v2 (some minor fixes as per Huang's good feedback)

  * Add some more details to the commit log in patch
    "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Early variant detection"

  * Add an empty line between variable declaration and function body
    in patch "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Use chip->cmdfunc instead of the internal".

  * Fix a build break caused by incomplete variable replacement:
    "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Replace host->page_size by mtd->writesize"

* Changes from v1

Aside from several changes based in Brian's feedback, the main changes
from v1 are:

  * The controller's clock source is now fully modeled, see patche 1 to 4.
    Of course, none of those patches should be taken through the mtd
    subsystem, but I'm adding them here for completeness.

  * The chip's cmdfunc() is now independently implemented in each SoC variant.
    The rationale behind this decision is that 'chunked' I/O is the only tested
    mode on the Armada370 variant, while the old 'vanilla' I/O is the only
    tested mode on the PXA variant.

    So it's safer to have an implementation for each variant.

  * Added support for BCH-8, in other words: 8-bits of correction in a 512-byte
    region. This is obtained by using a data chunk size of 1024B, thus doubling
    the ECC BCH strength, as per this ECC engine mechanism.

  * The ECC layout in use, which must be set according to the page size and
    desired ECC strength is now strictly chosen to match only the tested
    combinations.
