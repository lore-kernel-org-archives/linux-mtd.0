Sure. Will do that for v4 if we get there.

I understand. Just trying to spread the load and sending everywhere
via separate subsystems.

NEMC is going via greg-kh. They went through greg's char-misc-testing and
just got applied here.

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git/log/?h=char-misc-next

Do you think that can work for compile testing? It is the upstream tree with nemc.

I could point our github ones for the ci20 board.
But it has quite a bit of other code too for jz4780 support.

I apologize for the confusion. Rushing cause of 4.0-rc6

Yes. I followed all changes accordingly except one.

I don't think so.

of_translate_address traverses the DT nodes tree to get the addresses.
platform_get_resource would just give the sub-address.

the DT node in the SoC file for nemc is

		nemc: nemc@13410000 {
			compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-nemc";
			reg = <0x13410000 0x10000>;
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			ranges = <1 0 0x1b000000 0x1000000
			          2 0 0x1a000000 0x1000000
			          3 0 0x19000000 0x1000000
			          4 0 0x18000000 0x1000000
			          5 0 0x17000000 0x1000000
			          6 0 0x16000000 0x1000000>;

			clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_NEMC>;
		};

Then the DT node in the board file is

&nemc {
	/*
	 * Only CLE/ALE are needed for the devices that are connected, rather
	 * than the full address line set.
	 */
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pins_nemc_data &pins_nemc_cle_ale &pins_nemc_frd_fwe>;

	nand: nand@1 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-nand";
		reg = <1 0 0x1000000>;

		ingenic,nemc-tAS = <10>;
		ingenic,nemc-tAH = <5>;
		ingenic,nemc-tBP = <10>;
		ingenic,nemc-tAW = <15>;
		ingenic,nemc-tSTRV = <100>;

		ingenic,bch-device = <&bch>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <1024>;
		nand-ecc-strength = <24>;

		rb-gpios = <&gpa 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		wp-gpios = <&gpf 22 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pins_nemc_cs1>;

		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;

		partition@0 {
			label = "u-boot-spl";
			reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x800000>;
		};

		partition@0x800000 {
			label = "u-boot";
			reg = <0x0 0x800000 0x0 0x200000>;
		};

		partition@0xa00000 {
			label = "u-boot-env";
			reg = <0x0 0xa00000 0x0 0x200000>;
		};

		partition@0xc00000 {
			label = "system";
			reg = <0x0 0xc00000 0x1 0xff400000>;
		};
	};

	dm9000@6 {
		compatible = "davicom,dm9000";
		davicom,no-eeprom;

		reg = <6 0x0 1   /* addr */
		       6 0x2 1>; /* data */

		ingenic,nemc-tAS = <15>;
		ingenic,nemc-tAH = <10>;
		ingenic,nemc-tBP = <20>;
		ingenic,nemc-tAW = <50>;
		ingenic,nemc-tSTRV = <100>;

		reset-gpios = <&gpf 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		vcc-supply = <&eth0_power>;

		interrupt-parent = <&gpe>;
		interrupts = <19 0x4>;
	};
};

Hope this clears the use of of_translate_address
