Just reevaluated the "performance optimizations". On a VF610 SoC (with
L2 cache) the improvements increase performance by 2.5% and below. On a
VF500 SoC (without L2 cache) it seems to have slightly more impact, up
to 4%. Overall, it seems to influence write more than read.

Back then, when I implemented the improvements it certainly had a bigger
impact. I don't have strong opinion on that...
