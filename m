yep, this is what I have on the RN2120.

That's very weird. With the patch applied (I did not redo the whole set
of tests below w/o the patch):

Let's erase the first block of /dev/mtd4

  root@thin:~# flash_erase /dev/mtd4 0 1
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 0 -- 100 % complete 
  
Create a 2048 byte file:

  root@thin:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/page.raw bs=2048 count=1
  1+0 records in
  1+0 records out
  2048 bytes (2.0 kB) copied, 0.00104352 s, 2.0 MB/s

dd that file to the first block

  root@thin:~# dd if=/tmp/page.raw of=/dev/mtd4 bs=2048 count=1
  1+0 records in
  1+0 records out
  2048 bytes (2.0 kB) copied, 0.0008344 s, 2.5 MB/s

Do the same with nandwrite:

  root@thin:~# flash_erase /dev/mtd4 0 1
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 0 -- 100 % complete 

  root@thin:~# nandwrite /dev/mtd4 /tmp/page.raw 
  Writing data to block 0 at offset 0x0

As it seems to work, let's now try with a complete image:
    
  root@thin:~# flash_erase /dev/mtd4 0 0
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 72e0000 -- 99 % complete flash_erase: Skipping bad block at 07300000

  Writing data to block 5 at offset 0xa0000
  ^C[  422.406926] pxa3xx-nand d00d0000.nand: Ready time out!!!

So let's try again with a single page:
  
  root@thin:~# flash_erase /dev/mtd4 0 1
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 0 -- 100 % complete 

  root@thin:~# nandwrite /dev/mtd4 /tmp/page.raw 
  Writing data to block 0 at offset 0x0
  
FWIW, the version of nandwrite I have on my armhf debian is the
following (no specific bug report related to that version of
mtd-utils):

  root@thin:~# nandwrite --version
  nandwrite 1.5.0
  
  Copyright (C) 2003 Thomas Gleixner 
  
  nandwrite comes with NO WARRANTY
  to the extent permitted by law.
  
  You may redistribute copies of nandwrite
  under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence.
  See the file `COPYING' for more information.

Ok, so let's see if the problem appears if we write more than 1 block:
  
  root@thin:/tmp# flash_erase /dev/mtd4 0 3
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 40000 -- 100 % complete 
  
  root@thin:/tmp# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/3-blocks.raw bs=128K count=3
  3+0 records in
  3+0 records out
  393216 bytes (393 kB) copied, 0.120255 s, 3.3 MB/s
  
  root@thin:/tmp# nandwrite /dev/mtd4 /tmp/3-blocks.raw 
  Writing data to block 0 at offset 0x0
  Writing data to block 1 at offset 0x20000
  Writing data to block 2 at offset 0x40000
  
Now, I am starting to wonder if nandwrite does not try and do something
smart depending on the content of the file. So let's try and replace
our "mtd4ro" file by a file of same size filled with random:
  
  root@thin:~# ls -l mtd4ro 
  -rw-r--r-- 1 arno root 121634816 Dec  3 20:30 mtd4ro
  
  root@thin:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/whole.raw bs=128K count=928
  928+0 records in
  928+0 records out

  libmtd: error!: bad eraseblock number 928, mtd4 has 928 eraseblocks
  nandwrite: error!: /dev/mtd4: MTD get bad block failed
             error 22 (Invalid argument)
  nandwrite: error!: Data was only partially written due to error
             error 22 (Invalid argument)
  
  I don't believe it! It works as expected. As said previously, the
content of my "mtd4ro" is a simple a backup of the partition via
dd (a ubi fs):

  root@thin:~# hexdump -C mtd4ro | less

Just to be sure, I did the test three times for each input file: mtd4ro,
whole.raw, mtd4ro, whole.raw, mtd4ro, whole.raw:

 - whole.raw: no error the three times
 - mtd4ro: errors each time

Let's now try with the first block only:

  root@thin:~# dd if=mtd4ro of=/tmp/oneblock bs=128K count=1
  1+0 records in
  1+0 records out
  131072 bytes (131 kB) copied, 0.00126152 s, 104 MB/s

          error 5 (Input/output error)
  
AFAICT, it seems someone in the process does not like the UBI fs dump I
provide: nandwrite, your driver, mtd base code or the chip.

I took a very quick look at nandwrite code and it has some options to do
smart stuff but they seem to be all disabled by default when no cmd line
option is passed.

Could you try and dump the block to another flash. As I don't think I can
attach a binary blob to this email, can you drop the following in a
python shell:

l = ["55 42 49 23 01 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02",
     "00 00 08 00 00 00 10 00  16 9a 76 a5 00 00 00 00",
     "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00",
     "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 65 9c 26 3a",
     "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"*0x7b,
     "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00",
     "ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff",
     "ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff"*0x1f7f]

open("/tmp/block.raw", "w").write("".join(l).replace(' ', '').decode("hex"))

FWIW, you should have the following sha256 for the file:
d3e5534e054f2ab1220194c434d90fbfe9580459de887016db8e308739aa3a7b

If you have any additional idea, I am interested. I have no more time
this evening to test the other debug patch you sent but I will
definitely give it a try tomorrow.

If I did something stupid in the process, do not hesitate!

Cheers,

a+
