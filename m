I agree.

Except notifiers are by definition not attached to a specific MTD
device. I get your point, but I think we should clarify the different
concepts.

An mtd_notifier (which seems to also be called a user in a few places)
is something that should be called each time you have an MTD
creation/removal event (or when you add a notifier to the list). You
could have notifiers that don't do anything special with the MTD
device, hence they don't require private data.

I think we should add the mtd_user concept, which would be a specific
user of an MTD device that can contain private data and is likely to be
attached to the MTD device after the notifier's ->add() method is
called.

struct mtd_user_ops {
	int (*remove)(struct mtd_user *);
};

struct mtd_user {
	struct list_node node;
	const struct mtd_user_ops *ops;
}

int mtd_attach_user(struct mtd_info *mtd, struct mtd_user *user);
int mtd_detach_user(struct mtd_info *mtd, struct mtd_user *user);

and then inside the del_mtd_device() function, before you iterate over
all notifiers, you could iterate over all attached users and call their
->remove() method. If one fails, then you stop the removal procedure.
