So, if we follow your logic we should also have

		compatible = "jffs2,file-system";

Because JFFS2 is an MTD user, just as UBI is.

Let's see what Rob and other DT maintainers think about that.

Still, it seems to me that you're trying to solve a problem in the
kernel when it should actually be solved in an upper layer.

Another option would be to try attaching UBI (along with all possible
MTD users) to all the the MTD partitions. That's what's done for block
filesystems when rootfstype is not specified.
