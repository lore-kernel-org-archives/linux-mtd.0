I think that was answered in a previous email.

I will start with the AST2500 controllers only, which are consistent.

I agree, I will try to clarify the naming in the next version. I will keep 
the smc suffix for the driver name though.

I have added a bunch of IS_ALIGNED() in the next version to clarify what
