Unacceptable. Humans never make mistakes. ;)

Well, the repo I commit to (l2-mtd.git) was originally Artem's
creation and was intended to collect things that had been reviewed,
allowing David a last chance to review and reject or Sign-Off (or in
this case, break) patches. We haven't traditionally stuck to the "once
it's in git, it's permanent" philosophy, and I'm not sure of my
opinion of it. It may or may not have prevented this error, as I am
not sure why David left this patch out in the first place.

Sounds good.
