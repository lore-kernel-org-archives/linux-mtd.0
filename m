I doubt the Freescale BSP has fix the conflict, while the community=20
kernel does not
fix it.
Anyway, I will do more test on the mx23 board myself.

This is a very dangerous interface.

echo 0x20 > /sys/devices/platform/imx23-gpmi-nand/gpmi_debug

to show the GPMI register when the DMA timeout occurs.
