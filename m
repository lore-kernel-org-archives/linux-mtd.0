A hearty +1 to this. You are avoiding much of the core of the NAND
framework by avoiding the nand_chip callbacks and nand_scan_tail(), and
by reimplementing the BBT. I will have to NAK to some of the patches
that EXPORT the nand_base private core (e.g., nand_get_device()), and I
will most likely NAK the custom BBT implementation (please improve
nand_bbt.c as needed).

That's a possible approach if it still leaves your driver functional.
But I wouldn't trim the driver too much just for sake of reviewing.

BTW, why do you call this driver stm_nand_bch? BCH is a particular type
of ECC algorithm, not unique at all to ST's hardware. Can you drop the
_bch and make it just stm_nand? Also, you might want to change the
namespacing on some of your functions; for instance, I don't think you
can own the name bch_write(). Possibly prefix things with stm_* or
stm_nand_* where reasonable.
