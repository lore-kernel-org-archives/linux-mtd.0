Memory mapped will be of use whenever we try to read the flash content.
Instead of going through the entire SPI framework, and raising 
interrupts, we can
memcpy the flash contents. I am using it for mounting a jffs2 filesystem.

For me the memory mapped regions are like in the range 5c000000 - 
5fffffff, so
I can handle flash as large as 64MB.

As far as its comparison with DMA is concerned, I cant comment much 
about it.
My Qspi controller does not support DMA :(:(. So, memory mapped becomes the
best option option for me.

Thanks!
