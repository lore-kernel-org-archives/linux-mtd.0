One reason I didn't specifically say something like "not connected", is
because IIUC it's actually *possible* to have a robust boot sequence
without the RESET# pin -- e.g., if your boot ROM hardcoded a software
reset command (just because it's not really standardized doesn't mean
one can't do it).

Did you read my last response on the original thread? In my
understanding, there's always a way to, e.g., b0rk your exception
handlers, etc., such that you cannot guarantee your software fallbacks
will work. Normally, one would rely on a (hardware) watchdog to do your
last resort reset for you, but if said reset cannot also reset your boot
flash, then...you're stuck.

IOW, it's impossible.

Is that not an accurate description?

How else would we help someone figure out what's wrong with their
design? My best attempt is to make it quite obvious, as long as they're
using vanilla mainline: if their system hangs on reboot (without this
property), then it's probably a bad design.

And if instead, someone stuck in this DT property already, the loud
warning might suggest the reader look at the DT binding doc or code
comments, where I elaborated.
