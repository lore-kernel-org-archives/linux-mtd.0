Sorry, I perhaps replied a little to hastily and mixed up the
test numbers.

I just double checked and read up on the IRC backlog,
it actually _was_ 398 (see below).

I used this kernel tree: git://git.infradead.org/linux-ubifs.git

Plus the following patches: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/9/675

Using xfstests-dev: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git

Inside a Debian VM with scratch and test UBI volumes on nandsim.

This is fixed by the first patch in https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/9/675

Sorry again for the mix up. This is specifically what this patch is
trying to address.

But if there are different error codes with clearly outlined reasons
for returning each, wouldn't it be preferable to test that instead of
allowing an implementation to return arbitrary error codes?

To my understanding, that is what the test is trying to do there and at
least the ext4 rename and cross rename functions seem to care about
properly distinguishing between those cases.
