Both; the inode "leak" isn't filesystem-specific, beyond the fact that UBIFS
apparently limits the number of inodes on its orphan list while ext4 does not.
(How do I know it happens on ext4 then?  /proc/slabinfo shows that lots of ext4
inodes have been allocated, and after an unclean shutdown and remounting, it's
reported that 50,000+ orphan inodes were deleted.)

There are lots of cases in which path lookups switch from rcu-walk mode into
ref-walk mode, so the fact that it was being caused by ->d_revalidate() in this
specific situation isn't really important, IMO.

I think the actual fix would be something along the lines of making vfs_rmdir()
unhash any negative child dentries, so that they get "killed" by dput() later.
