No offense, that's my feeling too, hence the various reworks I've
recently initiated. Getting rid of the ->cmd_ctrl() ->cmdfunc()
approach in favor of a more generic ->exec_op() approach is one of them,
just need some time to figure a way to do it smoothly.

Yes, I know. I was not maintainer at that time, and was only reviewing
a few patches from time to time.
Now that I am, I try to answer as fast as possible. Note that the set
of requirements might have change with me, so even if someone add
agreed on you first submission but not taken the patches, I would have
required the same set of changes ;).
