I forgot few points. First, I did all Quad SPI tests using the Atmel QSPI
controller and driver.

I did no Dual SPI protocol test yet, only Quad SPI.

I'm able to test neither Quad nor Dual SPI protocols with the Atmel QSPI
protocol + m25p80 driver: this driver is not really suited for handling
the Atmel QSPI controller in its Serial Memory Mode.

However I did some non regression tests with the m25p80 driver used on the
regular Atmel SPI controller and driver (drivers/spi/spi-atmel.c) to
access a at25df312a memory (SPI 1-1-1 protocol).


Nonetheless the m25p80 driver was taken into account when I wrote the series.
Indeed Micron, Macronix and Spansion's datasheets provide tables giving the
number of dummy cycles to use depending on both the SPI bus clock
frequency and the Fast Read command. Hence in spi-nor.c, patch 2 sets
nor->read_dummy to the relevant number of dummy cycles (not bits).

Taking Spansion memories as an example, for their factory default Latency
Code value of 0, they expect:
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-1 (0x0b / 0x0c)
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-2 (0x3b / 0x3c)
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-4 (0x6b / 0x6c)

Fast Read 1-2-2 and 1-4-4 are not used with Spansion memories since the
number of dummy cycles to be used with one of these op codes is not suited
for the m25p80 driver.

For Micron and Macronix, except when their Quad SPI mode is enabled, the
Fast Read 1-1-4 or Fast Read 1-1-2 commands are preferred to the
Fast Read 1-4-4 or Fast Read 1-2-2 commands. The number of dummy cycles is
set to 0 for Read command (0x03) and 8 for other Fast Read commands since
this setting update can be done safely writing into volatile bits inside
configuration registers. A multiple of 8 dummy cycles is suited for the
m25p80_read() implementation.

Then looking at the m25p80 driver, the original (unchanged) cycles/bytes
conversion from the m25p80_read() hook only works with SPI 1-1-x protocols:

 	/* convert the dummy cycles to the number of bytes */
 	dummy /= 8;

As a matter of fact, 8 dummy cycles stand for:
-  8 bits (1 byte ) for SPI 1-1-z protocols
- 16 bits (2 bytes) for SPI x-2-z protocols
- 32 bits (4 bytes) for SPI x-4-z protocols

So I should also fix the above conversion in patch 3 to cover more SPI
protocols.
