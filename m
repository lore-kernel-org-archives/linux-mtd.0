add support for the davinci am1808 based enbw_cmc board.

This is thought as a RFC patchserie, as this patches
surely have to be discussed:

- ARM: davinci: configure davinci aemif chipselects through OF
  not moved to mfd, as mentioned in this discussion:
  http://davinci-linux-open-source.1494791.n2.nabble.com/PATCH-arm-davinci-configure-davinci-aemif-chipselects-through-OF-td7059739.html
  instead use a phandle in the DTS, so drivers which
  uses the davinci aemif, can call davinci_aemif_setup_timing_of()

  This is just thought as an RFC ... The enbw_cmc board
  support not really need to setup this bus timings, as
  they are setup in U-Boot ... but I want to post this,
  as I think, it is a nice to have, and I am not really
  sure, if this has to be a MFD device (If so, all bus
  interfaces for other SoCs should be converted also to
  MFD devices) ... as an example how this can be used
  I add this to the davinci nand controller OF support
  patch, in this patchserie.

- ARM: davinci: mux: add OF support
  I want to get rid of the pin setup code in board code ...
  This patch introduces a davinci_cfg_reg_of() function,
  which davinci drivers can call, if they found a
  "pinmux-handle", so used in the following drivers in
  this patchserie:

  drivers/net/ethernet/ti/davinci_emac
  drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-davinci.c
  drivers/mtd/nand/davinci_nand.c

- post this board support with USB support, even though
  USB is only working with the 10 ms "workaround", posted here:
  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.usb.general/54505
  I see this issue also on the AM1808 TMDXEXP1808L evalboard.

- MMC and USB are not using OF support yet, ideas how to port
  this are welcome. I need for USB and MMC board specific
  callbacks, how to solve this with OF support?
