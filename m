It would be a problem if the use of this clock would be at dts level
for each board. But here we only setup this property in the dtsi at SoC
level. So enforcing the order is not a problem as the dtsi are all well
reviewed and remains pretty rare.

I really wanted to avoid adding more code only for legacy reason.

Indeed it makes sens.

We can't do this because we need to be bacwkard compatible.

OK
