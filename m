... but now that I think of it, how is this any different from, say,
AES in CTR mode? The counter is big endian, but apart from that, using
IVs derived from a counter will result in the exact same issue, only
with a shift of 16 bytes.

That means using file block numbers as IV is simply inappropriate, and
you should encrypt them first like is done for AES-CBC
