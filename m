Squashfs stores significantly more metadata than cramfs.  Remember 
cramfs has no support for filesystems > ~ 16Mbytes, no inode timestamps, 
truncates uid/gids, no hard-links, no nlink counts, no hashed 
directories,  no unique inode numbers.  If Squashfs didn't compress the 
metadata it would be significantly larger than cramfs.
