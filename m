Interestingly, we do not see this problem with Cygnus or NSP, but only 
on NS2 (arm64 based). There may be a difference between how OF devices 
are instantiated between arm and arm64?

Yes, I see that too (after sending out my previous email, :)). Maybe 
Anup can help to elaborate on the problem. I'm now getting a bit 
confused on how the problem can surface on NS2.

But in general, I think it's a good idea to relax the requirement in the 
DT binding document to not require "brcm,brcmnand", in the case when 
"brcm,nand-iproc" and "brcm,nand-bcm63138" are present.
