Right, sorry I missed that subtlety.

I see.

My goal was to start forcing people to use a complete compatible string
to avoid the "garbage,chip-name" that you mentioned in the other thread.

The vendor are not relevant in the current implementation because how the
SPI core is implemented but I think that shouldn't affect the accuracy on
which hardware is described in the DT.

Yes, you are right that is hard to come with a reasonable list specially since
the vendor and chip relation could be N:1 as you said.

$SUBJECT is definitely an improvement over the current doc that mentions the
"m25p_ids" table in the driver though. So we can update later the DT binding
once / if the SPI core is modified to report proper OF modalias so OF-only
drivers can get rid of their SPI id table.

So for this patch:
