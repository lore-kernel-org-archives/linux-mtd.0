The cost of a block device node in the kernel is rather low. Nowadays,
sysfs does not even permanently use inodes for entries, it has a much
more compact internal representation IIRC.

The main advantage of this approach is not having to set up the 
block device at all, it would just be there, which e.g. makes it
possible to put a root file system on it or do something else without
requiring a user space tool to issue an ioctl.

Evidently you can do everything you need even with that user space
tool, but IMHO the complexity of doing that is way bigger than
just creating the block devices right away.

It's not a dummy bus, in this approach it would be a the bus that gets
used by all ubiblk devices, which is a very common concept by itself.
It's more like the classic understanding of a 'device class' that Greg
wants to see get replaced by bus_types in the kernel.
