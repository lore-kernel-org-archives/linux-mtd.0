Well, I got this understanding by talking to the OMAP maintainer and by
chatting with rmk. But I might be wrong. So the understanding is that
board data extending is banned, at least for a while. And the arm world
has to consolidate and probably switch to the DT tree approach. This
would be painful, this would make some vendors to return to behind the
curtains, so this would be a step back in the short run.

But in a couple of years this would be resolved, may be under Linaro's
aegis, and then the arm world would make 2 steps forward, so that
previous step back would be compensated in the longer run.

But! I'm just an small MTD guy, so I might be mistaken. Of course if you
make your board file changes be merged via the corresponding arm
sub-tree - go ahead send your MTD driver updates! This is I guess the
answer to your "what do you suggest" question.

CCing the arm lists so that people could correct me.
