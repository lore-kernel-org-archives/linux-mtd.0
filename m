As Pekon just said, the driver can take this action, once the NAND core
has detected the NAND device width and bail out.

I really don't see why we need to *enforce* that in the NAND core.

Well, I *think* I never said that, and this patch doesn't imply that
either. All the patch is doing is using x8 buswidth until the width is
detected. Then it switches to whatever the width was detected to.

Uh? I'm not requiring NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO at all.

Uh? Both (1) and (2) are already handled by this patch, regarding the
initial device detection.

On which arguments?

To be honest with you, I'm a bit lost about your feedback :-)

I guess you *did* read the patch, right? It's pretty straight-forward
and it fixes a *current* bug: 16-bit devices *cannot* be ONFI
detected.

All the patch does is:

1. Set defaults to x8

2. Detect device. Either method works.

3. Set defaults to detected width, x8 or x16.

The NAND driver is free, after the detection, to error-out, print a
message, or re-arrange the callbacks.

Which part exactly of the above do you disagree with?

Now, maybe I went to far talking about removing this or that, but as far
as the ONFI detection, I think the change is pretty-straightforward.

(I'll reply to your suggestion in the proper mail)
