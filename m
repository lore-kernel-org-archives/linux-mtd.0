It depends from which side you are looking at this!!

There are more than 16 nvmem providers in kernel which use this bindings 
and they are fine!!

I obviously take some of your concerns w.r.t bindings and there is a 
scope of making the bindings much robust, most importantly the #address 
and #size-cells. But having a subnode still sounds very fragile to me, 
and this could be much specific case of MTD provider. We might have 
instances where this could be sub-sub node of the the original provider 
for other providers. Also I do not want to bring in Provider specifics 
into this bindings. If single level of subnode works for your case and 
the below patch works for you then I would recommend lets move on and 
try to get this going.

Sure!!
This will give more flexibility to other provider drivers!
