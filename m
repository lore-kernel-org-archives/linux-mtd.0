You mean 0x3000_0000 - 0x33ff_ffff (with one less 'f'), or am I wrong? But 
0x0400_0000 is only 64MiB, how can this map 128MiB SPI NOR? I am still not 
connecting with you here, I am sorry.

Does the QSPI controller simply chomp away N MiB of CPU address space? How big 
is the maximum N here ? I was under the impression that N=64 , but now I am a 
bit confused by your claim that you can use 128 MiB SPI NOR.

OK, got it, thanks for explaining!
