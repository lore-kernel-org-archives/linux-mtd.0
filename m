Sorry, I still have troubles to understand your use case.
Both of you seem to hate the kernel command line for reasons
I don't fully understand so far.

What is the need of this? Use use the kernel command line to tell UBI from which MTD to attach.

Same question here.

Ditto.

Ditto.

Sorry, but this is just a tooling problem and not to be addressed in the kernel.
There is also the possibility to use an initramfs (either as file or embedded in the kernel)
if the mount/attach logic becomes *really* complicated...

As I said, as far I'm informed device tree is for configuring Linux, it describes
the hardware. We also don't have LVM, DM or iSCSI bindings in DT. ;)
Maybe device tree folks will tell more...
