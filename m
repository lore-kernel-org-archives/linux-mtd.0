Ah, oops, my apologies. I came across this when searching for the
(committed) patch in my mail history and didn't notice the driver name
differences. :)

That in itself seems broken; if he is pulling code from you he shouldn't rebase.

What you could do is send just a patch, not a pull request. But anyway:
