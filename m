Urgh.

I was under the impression that specifying multiple constraints would mean
that it would try "o", then if that didn't work it would fall back to "Q".
That's certainly the behaviour we've seen in the past... has this changed
with recent toolchains?

The problem with using "Q" on its own is that the compiler tends to generate
the address computation twice: once for "Q" and once for "r" -- this doesn't
happen with "o", where the address is computed once. This leads to an
increase in register pressure and I have seen the compiler choke claiming
that the inline asm block contains "impossible constraints" because it
insists on generating the address twice.

It sounds like we need to:

	(a) Understand what has changed in GCC to cause this error to start
	    cropping up.

	(b) Have a look at the impact of using only "Q" on the generated
	    code (especially register usage for the address).
