You mean, using a dedicated logic to control the CS lines rather than a
GPIO (controlled by the SW using gpio_set_value())?

It that's the case then I suggest doing it the other way around.
When you want to use a plain GPIO you should define something like:

	cs-gpios =3D <&pioC X>;

If it's not there the controller should use it's internal logic to
control the CS line.

BTW, you seem to support controlling several CS using the same
controller, which means you'll have to specify which CS the NAND chip
is connected to (see [1]).

Hm, is that really required? If the R/B line is shared among several
NAND chips, it should be transparent, you just have to specific which
chip is connected to which GPIO (or dedicated R/B pin).

Can this be extracted from the timing mode exposed by the NAND chip.
IMO it shouldn't be defined in the DT.

We recently added more constraints on the 'NAND controller/NAND chip'
representation in the DT [1].
You should rework your binding (and your code) to match these
constraints, even if you controller is only able to interface with a
single NAND chip.

Thanks,

Boris
