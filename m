Great, thank you :). I just tested the patch and it works for me. The
erased page bitflips are still detected and fixed. I will send a new
version then.

Hi Markus,

Could you please share how to verify the patch, in other words, how to repr=
oduce the
UBIFS corruption issue consistently. Thanks.

Best Regards,

Markus
