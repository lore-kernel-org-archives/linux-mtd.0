Of course they shouldn't refer to the driver. That's the main point of
my comment. But just because the ID made its way into the driver doesn't
mean it's always a useful or necessary DT binding. More below.

But not all entries in m25p80.c are actually used as DT bindings. There
are platform devices that share the same mechanism; there are
devices which are 99.9% (100%?) compatible with others on the list and
don't actually require a separate DT binding at all; and there are
entries that were added just for the SW support, while any user was
still binding against the original "<manufacturer>,m25p80".

Anyway, I'll consider your suggestions, and I'll probably include most
or all all the ID strings in the binding documentation in the end.

Thanks all. I see that I've gotten an ack from Mark as well (thanks!),
so I'll apply this (plus the fixup I just sent) to linux-mtd.git and
probably pullreq it before the weekend is over. I'll assume Rafal and
Geert will take care of following up on their DTS submissions that added
"nor-jedec", but let me know if you'd rather me take care of it. I'll
try to keep an eye open as we get nearer to the next merge window, to
make sure the wrong entries don't get through.

BTW, in case I misled anyone previously: I believe there are no
"nor-jedec" entries in *.dts for Linus' current tip; there are only
entries queued up in linux-next for 4.2, presumably.
