I was using this information.

   Table 31-18. ECC Status Word Field Definition

   7            0 Page has been successfully corrected
   CORFAIL      1 Page is uncorrectable

   5=E2=80=930          Number of errors that have been corrected in this p=
age
   ERROR_COUNT

This is from the Vybrid RM, but the MPC5125RM has the same information.

I have definitely tested the detection of 'erased pages'.  However, I
don't know that I ever had actual bit flips.

The ECC controller has no idea whether the page is empty or not.  Are
you saying you have an erased page with bit flips?  I have definitely
not tested this.

There are two issues.

 1) erased page with some physical flipped bits (zero).
 2) erased page were controller flipped some bits.

Currently, the code is only handling case 2 (that is what the controller
counts).  I believe that your physical page has actual 'stuck at zero'
bits.  The current driver gives up.  If you want to handle this then we
should replace the lines,

> +	/* ECC failed. */
> +	if (flip > ecc_count)
> +		return -1;

With something like,

 +	/* Not completely empty. */
 +	if (flip > ecc_count) {
 +           re_read_page_w_ecc_off();
 +           if (count_written_bits() > strength) /* strength/2 ? */
 +		return -1;
 +      }

There is also a discussion on this here,

Here Brian says that 3b applies to SLC NAND.  I guess this is you :).

It is fairly common to read an erased page.  Doing 'raw reads' all the
time on an erased page will slow the file system.  However, doing
re-reads for an erased page with bit flips is probably fairly uncommon.
A flash in this state maybe near EOL or the sector was bad from the
factory but not marked so.

I am chasing an DDR2 issue on another CPU and haven't had much more time
to the look at the Vybrid nor follow the MTD mailing list.  I don't know
if the 'NAND_ECC_NEED_CHECK_FF' feature has been merged?  It may also
solve the issue.
