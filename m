I was also suggesting you to use nvmem-cell subnode, but make it a 
proper nvmem provider device, rather than reusing its parent device.

You would end up some thing like this in dt.

flash@0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "s25sl064a";
	reg = <0>;

	nvmem-cells {
		compatible = "mtd-nvmem";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		calibration: calib@404 {
			reg = <0x404 0x10>;
		};
	};
};
