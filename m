But the proper name should be in the compatible property.

How does the SPI core know to use m25p80? From the ids, and the compatible
value. If you won't add new names, all devices should declare compatiblity
with "m25p80" (that's "spansion,m25p80", right?) as a fallback.
However, are all devices really compatible with m25p80?
I.e. does m25p80.c work will all devices, in the absense of support for the
real device? If not, the fallback must not be there, and new device names
must be added.

Autoloading is based on "spi:<name>". If new names aren't added, m25p80
won't be loaded for new SPI FLASHes, unless I'm missing something?
