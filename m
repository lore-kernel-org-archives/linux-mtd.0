Yes, sorry, I was just over-reacting because I'm tired earing that the
only solution to get a high performances is to hide everything in the
controller which is likely to be incompatible with NANDs we'll see in a
few month from there.

Hm, I think it's changing now that a lot of SoCs are advertised to be
running Linux. But you're right in that existing IPs might not support
this low-level mode.

Hm, I don't understand why it's not possible to implement basic
sequences, but I don't know anything about FTNANDC024, so let's assume
you're right.

Sure, feel free to send it to me, I'll have a look. And maybe you can
also share your code (both the new and old versions of the driver).

The raw vs ECC mode thing was just an example to illustrate my point:
people usually lie (intentionally or not) about what's really
supported :).

Yes, that's a problem.

Raw access is usually not something you expect to be fast, it's here to
help people debugging their implementation, or providing a fallback
when ECC correction failed (which should not happen that often).
So it's fine if it's providing fast.

Hm, so you can't even move the column pointer within a page
(NAND_CMD_RNDOUT)?
Even if it's the case, as I said, raw access is mainly here for
debugging purpose, so the read-disturbance caused by the multiple page
load operations shouldn't be a problem.

Nope, this one won't work. That's completely crazy to prevent one from
doing such basic things, but given you previous explanation I'm not
really surprised.

Now back to the Evatronix IP. I had a closer look at Ricard's code, and
it seems the controller is actually supporting a low-level mode
(command seq 18 and 19 + MAKE_GEN_CMD()).

So my suggestion is to implement ->cmd_ctrl() and use these generic
commands. And of course optimized/packed accesses (using specific
commands) can be used in ecc->read/write_page(). This would require a
flag to ask the core to not send the READ/WRITE commands before calling
ecc->read/write_page(), but that's doable.
All other commands would use the generic mode, since they don't require
high performances or any specific handling.

This way you don't have to implement your own ->cmdfunc() function, you
can get rid of all the specific ID/ONFI detection logic (the generic
commands should allow you to retrieve those information) and rely on the
default implementation.

Ricard, would that work?
