This changes will be made by me or maintainers? If current this
functions are not supported, i decide not to implement my lock, unlock
function as well.

Sorry, you are right. This field is unnecessary for my driver.
Instead, compatible is replaced. I will update it with 2nd version.

Umm. This does not seem right to me. Just look at sector_start <
number_sector / 2. From the altera EPCQ datasheet
(http://www.altera.com.my/literature/hb/cfg/cfg_cf52012.pdf), such as
EPCQ16 (page 19,20). Sector start <number_sector/2 is the case where
TB = 1 (table 17). In this table we have few options and sr_bp =
__ilog2_u32(num_sectors) is only cover for the sector from 0 to 15 to
be protected.

I will remove this since it is unnecessary.
