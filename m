Well given the reset of your comments, I guess you could write an
empty one (or one with a BUG() or WARN()?).

[snip nice description; I did read it!]

Right. I didn't quite think through this whole process.

I think a short (few lines) comment in the code to describe the
justification for using NAND_BBT_NO_OOB_BBM is in order for v4. And
maybe include a bit of this in the commit message as well.

Yes, it can be. But no, I don't think it's likely. There are very few,
rare instances where we have to modify the BBT (and thereby make it
susceptible to corruption), and those instances have some level of
robustness to them. Of course, they still have room for improvement.
(I suppose there could as be corruption due to read disturb; but this
is also handled now, by scrubbing the affected BBT blocks that return
-EUCLEAN, refreshing them with clean data.)

Personally, I've experienced "corruption" primarily when I have boards
where I change the ECC configuration; then the BBT scan sees -EBADMSG
and has to rebuild the table.

Hmm, not really. We've kind of co-opted the idea of the factory bad
block marker as a secondary, distributed bad block table in the
kernel. It's not really the expected use case, and it breaks in cases
like yours, since we don't support a third form of bad block
marker/table for post-initial-scan markers. I think the best solution
in this case is just to rely solely on the BBT after the first scan.
