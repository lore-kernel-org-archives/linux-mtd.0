On one hand, there are lots of, let's call them, home users, that use major distributions with udev, so the distribution maintainers can reasonably decide which scheduler to use for which type of device based on the udev rule and common sense provided via Documentation/ by linux-block devs. Moreover, most likely, those rules should be similar or the same across all the major distros and available via some (systemd?) upstream.

Yeah, but let me add that currently all our released kernels still use legacy
block stack for SCSI by default and thus CFQ/deadline. And once we feel
scsi-mq + BFQ is comparable enough for rotating disks (which may be after
your latest changes, Andreas will be running some larger evaluation), we
are going to switch to that instead of scsi + CFQ. So it's not like for us
it is a question between deadline-mq and BFQ, it is rather between scsi +
CFQ vs scsi-mq + BFQ.
