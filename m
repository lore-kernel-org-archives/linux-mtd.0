Yup, I'm using the same hack to clean the (not really) bad blocks from
the table. FWIW, the MTD people has been playing with some idea to
kernel support to unmark bad blocks from the bad block table, but
nothing was merged and (AFAIK) nobody is working on it. So patches are
welcome!

Well, I'm not sure yet what's going on. Do you have any spare NAND partition
to run some destructive testings?

In that case, please run:

$ nandtest /dev/mtd{X}

Be careful as you _will_ destroy all your data on that partition!

Thanks for such brave testings!
