What the meaning of "standard chips"?

There are many nands in the world. Every vendor has its own rules, some 
even does has :)

Unluckily, the imx23/imx28 supports many nands that the nand_ids{} does 
not support.
I have many nands by my hand. I will add it gradually.

I want to get the page size/oob size from my own database which can not 
get from the nand_ids.

Most of the time, the timing is really based on a safe timing setting.
But in the original GPMI driver in the FREESCALE BSP, there exits some
nands need to be set with their own timing setting.

So I do not use the safe timing for _ALL_ the nand, and i'd better get 
it from the
database.

thanks , I will try to change the code according to your advice.
