It is possible that by the time this was designed and tested, and the
baseline you are now using, there have been changes in how probing is
done and resolved. I have not been able to pin point which commit would
be responsible for that, but it would not surprise me that something
changed in that area, especially with all the on-going on-demand probing
business happening.
