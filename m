Hi Rafał,

Thanks for drudging up my old work. This is something that's been stuck
too far down in my stack of TODOs that it essentially timed out...

I mentioned the missing changelog on IRC, but to fill in the gaps:
essentially you've dropped the partition parser and associated bindings
I had in my series (for the 'Google FMAP' format). That's fine, but I
just wanted to note it.

And with that, I think you've not quite nailed the purpose of my
original patch. This now seems to suggest there are other potential
bindings here, but then you leave the reader hanging. One note to that
effect below. If that's the only objection, then I can make the
additions myself when applying.

We've suggested above that there may be "different ways" (fixed vs.
on-flash tables) to partition, but then we still only describe one way.
Maybe we can just paste something like this as a caveat before moving
on?

"We currently only document a binding for fixed layouts."

We can delete that in the presumed follow-up that proposes the
"on-flash" parser bindings. Sound OK?
