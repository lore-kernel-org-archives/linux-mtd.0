Thanks for doing this!

However, the table generation still looks overly complicated to me, with
too much duplication which needs to be kept in sync.

Oops... These will get out of sync.

Can't you just have the IDs in a header file only, and let the header file
generate either a struct flash_info or a struct spi_device_id table, using
a macro defined by the file that includes it?
Cfr. include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h and its use of __SYSCALL()?

Or am I missing something (e.g. this is impossible due to the hyphens in the
names?).
