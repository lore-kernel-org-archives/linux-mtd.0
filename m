Frankly speaking, Which nand we should to support depends on the 
customer's requires.

So we really do not want to support other nands that the customer does 
not have.

I ever thought to change the generic database. But I found it would cost 
a long time.

The parsing code in nand_get_flash_type() can not parse out the page 
size/oob size
in some cases. And IMHO I do not think to get the page size/oob size by 
parsing the ids is a good way,
this really makes the code mess (sorry, David, I really think the 
current code is ugly.).

IMHO, the best solution is add a database like mine. Using the id bytes 
as the keyword to match the nand.
then to get the page size /oob size , etc, from the database.

I will send a patch about this in future, but now, I do not want to  be 
stumbled by this problem.

The timing information is needed by the GPMI module, not other module. 
So the
best way to get this is from the chip database.

Setting the GPMI with the proper timing will make the NAND runs in high 
performance.

Thanks for your advice, I will use the safe timing for all the nand.
