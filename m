Hi Bill,

The flash chip mentioned above requires 8-bit error correction per 512
byte block, hence I increased the ECC to the maximum available level
(60-byte ECC, see page below). One thing which is not very nice, in
order to fit the 60-byte ECC into the 64-byte OOB, I had to shorten the
BBT pattern and set it at the very beginning of the page. This works
fine, however this basically sets the page also to factory bad, I'm not
sure if this is ok? Otherwise, we also could use a BBT pattern of length
1 (used by cafe_nand.c too).

What do you think? I would like to respin the NFC patch, with my U-Boot
changes and this change included...
