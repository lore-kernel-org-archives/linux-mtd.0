Agreed that dummy'd be easy to go for now tho, doesn't it give any security
concern at all, even only for ext4 testing purpose? Is there a chance to hack
the mount option in runtime? BTW, it may be doable to build an encrypt root
inode having encrypted dentry of lost_found, given dummy_context in mke2fs.
I'm just curious whether or not it'd be worth to do.
