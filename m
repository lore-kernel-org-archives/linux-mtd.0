Sounds good.  And if a matching entry isn't found (as in the case of a
concurrent unlink), what happens?  The answer must be the same as for
ext4, but I've forgotten the details....  I guess it must find the next
highest cookie (thinking of the cookie as a 64-bit integer of some kind)
that exists in the directory.  And that must be the same order that
readdir normally returns entries in.
