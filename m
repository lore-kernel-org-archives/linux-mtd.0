That may be a good idea.  Looking at the old thread, I share Herbert's concern
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg21231.html) about there likely not
being more than one implementation of each KDF algorithm.  So, perhaps some
simple helper functions would be more appropriate.  However, making the KDFs be
covered by self-tests would be very nice.

Also, it seems your patch
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg21137.html) doesn't allow a salt
to be passed in.  In order to fully support HKDF, crypto_rng_reset() (which as I
understand would be the way to invoke the "extract" step) would somehow need to
accept both the input keying material and salt, both of which are arbitrary
length binary.

Eric
