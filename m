Why would you want NO_OOB_BBM without no-blockmark-swap? If the block is
bad, why do you care what's written to it? (For that matter, why is it
ever important to use NO_OOB_BBM? At worst, the extra BB marks are
useless / written to the wrong place.)

Yes, it is a misinterpretation, and it's really irrelevant in many cases
whether or not the BB mark is written to each block's OOB. But it does
still provide some resilience in case the on-flash table ever gets
completely corrupted -- nand_bbt will rescan the flash for BB marks on
the next boot (and this will be totally broken--with or without
NO_OOB_BBM--for hardware like yours). Or to put it another way, it
supports some legacy scenarios without (AFAICT) any real negative
effects.

Certainly. But that's not an argument against attempting.

We don't "rely" on this. If the BBT (and its mirrors) never completely
fails, these marks are never used.

I'm not convinced the NO_OOB_BBM DT property is actually necessary at
all.

I was more concerned about bad block *table* properties, where I see
that at least some users (e.g. ST Micro's BCH NAND driver) expect a
different BBT format than the default, and we might begin to see extra
boolean flags for random bits of differentiation. This is apparently
still just a theoretical concern, though.
