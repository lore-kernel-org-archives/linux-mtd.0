Well, the problem is that hashes may not be sufficient to uniquely identify a
name in all cases.  f2fs uses only a 32-bit hash so it's trivial to create
collisions on it, as I demonstrated.  Even collisions of two 32-bit hashes, as
used by ext4 and ubifs, are possible.  And ext4 currently doesn't even compare
the hashes during directory searches, beyond using them to find the correct
directory block, since the hashes aren't stored in the directory entries.

Could this mean that telldir()/seekdir() is unreliable too, probably.  But for
lookups of the "digested" names we aren't limited to just the 64-bit readdir
position, so we can avoid duplicating the bug.  Also, collisions in the digested
names are very problematic since they result in undeletable files, rather than
just poor performance and broken telldir()/seekdir().
