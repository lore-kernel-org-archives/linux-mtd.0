Not sure what you have in mind since NAND and NOR flash work very
differently, and SPI vs. memory-mapped is also very different.

But to add to the spinand review comments two things caught
my eye on quick glance over the code:

> +#define mu_spi_nand_driver_version "Beagle-MTD_01.00_Linux2.6.33_20100507"

seems like an unused leftover?  if the version number is
important then maybe better put it in commit message?

> +/bin/bash: 4: command not found

how did this get in there?
