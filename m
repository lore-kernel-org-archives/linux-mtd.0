Random internet search gives you ie.
https://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx10/isehelp/pim_r_promformatter_files.htm

I recall there was some perl script to do the same too.

And so, we're starting to invent a convoluted scheme to describe policy
in DT ; I don't like this.

What would you do once the FPGA requires another bit order, would you
add another DT property and more stuff to the kernel to handle it ? I
don't think this scales. Going ad-absurdum, I might want to be lazy and
try to dd a SOF file into a partition and hope the kernel will convert
it to RBF and do the right thing ...

But we won't put a SOF-to-RBF parser into the kernel. I don't see a
reason why we should put this bit swapping into the kernel. Just let the
user (in this case, FPGA developer) prepare the bitstream in the correct
format and write it into the flash.
