Ok, I will modify this comment.

Ok, I will simplify the description of "reg" property.

"st,fmc2-timings" is an optional property that allow the end user to 
overwrite the timings calculated by setup_data_interface callback. By 
setting this property in the NAND flash memory device tree node, the end 
user could have a better throughput. For NON ONFI SLC NAND, timing mode 
0 is often used.
