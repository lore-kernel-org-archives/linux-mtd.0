Ok, so that needs to be in the commit message, and a comment
where we validate the device config on startup.  ;)

Generic tests do use dm-flakey:

$ git grep _require_dm_flakey tests/generic
tests/generic/311:_require_dm_flakey
tests/generic/321:_require_dm_flakey
tests/generic/322:_require_dm_flakey
tests/generic/325:_require_dm_flakey
$

There's no reason why generic tests can't use the loop device,
either. Indeed, 10 days ago we added an abstraction to allow generic
tests to easily use the loop device (i.e. added _mkfs_dev).

Understood - all I'm trying to do is work out what exactly what the
impact of TEST_DEV/SCRATCH_DEV not being block devices on a local
filesystem. Network filesystems are sufficiently different that this
isn't an issue, but char vs block local devices is a little more
subtle.

Hmmm - there's ~140 generic tests in the auto group - I would have
expected a lot more of them to run than 76....

... and what I'm particularly interested in is how many of those
are a result of tests assumes that they are running on a block or
network device.

Ok, so that probing can be done fairly easily. Right at the end of
common/config there's a blkid command run to grab the FSTYP value
from the $TEST_DEV. If returns a null, then we can check for it
being a UBI volume and set FSTYP automatically.

Ok, I can see the match, but you're not validating that it is a char
device once you have a match, and so that will accept anything with
"/ubi" in it....

Hmmm, now I see you check for char device here - it shouldn't be
necessary as we shouldn't even have got to this statement if the
SCRATCH_DEV is not a char device. i.e. validate it when pulling in
the config, then it can simply be assumed valid everywhere else if
it is set.

Cheers,

Dave.
