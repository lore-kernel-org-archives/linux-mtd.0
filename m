Thanks.
I can confirm that if I apply this patch, my system won't reboot
properly (as expected), and if I then add

		broken-flash-reset;

to the jedec,spi-nor device, it starts functioning correctly again.

I don't like the pejorative "broken", and it also suggests that a thing
used to work, but something happened to break it - this is not
accurate.
I would prefer something like "reset-not-connected" which is an accurate
description of the state of the hardware.

I also think that having a WARN_ON is an over-reaction.  Certainly a
warning could be appropriate, but just one pr_warn() should be enough.
The "problem" is unlikely in practice, and loudly warning people that an
asteroid might kill them isn't particularly helpful.

I genuinely think that if the system fails to reboot, then Linux is at
fault. I accept that changing Linux to be completely robust might be
more trouble than it is worth, but I don't accept that it is impossible.

But I don't intend to fight either of these battles.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
