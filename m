=0A=
Yes, correct. The scheduling policy in itself does not really matter, but s=
hould=0A=
not deviate from the mandatory HM write policy: "within a sequential write=
=0A=
required zone, writes must be issued sequentially". That could somewhat imp=

Yes. These are the helper functions handling the zone write locking to simp=

the task of the scheduler to limit the number of in-flight write request to=
 one=0A=
per zone at most at any time. This is the trick to avoid write reordering=
=0A=
stack-wide, since most of the time, reordering happens not because of the=

=0A=
It was rather easy with deadline, but the scheduler code was simple to star=
t=0A=
with. Basically, the only thing needed is on dispatch to skip any write req=
uest=0A=
to a zone that is already locked (i.e. a write is already ongoing). For rea=
ds,=0A=
there are no constraints so nothing needs to be changed. Zone unlocking mus=
t be=0A=
done on completion of the write request so the scheduler completion method =

to change a little too.=0A=

=0A=
Yes, that is debatable. But the above "one write per zone" trick can be als=
o=0A=
handled by an application, which makes using any other scheduler OK. Look a=
t the=0A=
recent SMR support code in fio from Bart. Some of the tests (in t/zbd) for =
some=0A=
I/O patterns are just fine with any scheduler. In fact any pattern is OK be=
cause=0A=
fio is SMR aware and never issues more than one write per zone. That is how=
ever=0A=
true only and only for I/O sizes that are small enough as to not cause the=
=0A=
kernel to generate multiple BIOs for each I/O call. Otherwise, deadline &=
=0A=
mq-deadline become necessary.=0A=
=0A=
But I agree, it is a little fragile. Application developer and sysadmins re=
ally=0A=
need to know what will be running on the disk to make the right choice. And=
=0A=
knowing that is not necessarily straightforward.=0A=
