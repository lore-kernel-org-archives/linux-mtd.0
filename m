Huh? That's completely wrong. You're assuming I have a single-register
FIFO, when in fact, I have a memory-mapped hardware buffer. Maybe you're
looking for memcpy_{to,from}io()? I see this is not optimized at all,
though.

Right, which is why it's a separate helper function in my driver, and it
will stay with __raw_{read,write}l().

You suggested the wrong helper, and the "right" helper is *not*
optimized. It even has comments saying "this needs to be optimized".

While the ARM case is rock-solid in my favor, I would appreciate an
answer to the asm-generic case too; do you really expect that any sane
compiler would break up word-aligned volatile stores into smaller (e.g.,
8-bit) stores? As I said, I think that means every driver written in C
is broken, not just the ones using your pet enemies,
__raw_{read,write}l().
