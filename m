It's a combination of things - smartphones are definitely part of the
target audience but other things can be affected, I'd guess your
streaming TV player example can have issues if it's got local storage
and downloads things in the background for example.  There's definitely
systems that never really use storage once they're booted but there's
also things that move data around and/or have interactive apps.  Even
with some of the things that don't really use storage at runtime it can
be important to help cut down boot times.
