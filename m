Yes, we will need 6 bytes of ID.  The "dirty" stm_spi_fsm driver already handles
arbitrary-length IDs.  This will need to be pulled into the "upstream" version
at some point.

The config() callback is used to perform device/vendor specific initialisation
(e.g. how to set the QE bit) and configuration of the read, write, and erase
operations.  As such, it is related to the device, not to the driver or H/W
controller.

However, I take your point, it is rather ugly.  In some sense, the callback is
used to make up for the lack of information in the table that would otherwise
permit a generic configuration to be made.  One option would be to extend the
table structure to include the superset of properties required across all
devices, or perhaps an entry for extended, vendor-specific properties.

In any case, I think this discussion relates more to the spi-nor thread, rather
than the st_spi_fsm driver.

Personally, I think it is easier to read with the flag combinations defined near
where they are used.  I do not have strong feeling either way though, and it may
become a moot point if the table structure is changed :-)
