Ok, thats fine...

I do not have plans to convert cadence QSPI driver to spi-mem yet,
mainly due to lack of time. Also, not sure if original author Marek and
other altera people are okay with that.

I see couple of issues in the way of conversion:
1. I would wait to know what direction would direct mapping APIs[1] go
before starting spi-mem conversion for Cadence QSPI driver. Else, we
have may to re write again if direct mapping APIs are merged.
2. New Cadence OSPI IP has an integrated PHY to support high throughput
OSPI flashes operating up 200MHz in Octal DDR mode. In order to work
with such flashes, PHY DLLs need to be calibrated. Highly simplified
calibration sequence is as below(See [2] for actual sequence):
-Read flash ID at low speed and store it.
-Enable PHY and set DLLs to a defined initial value
-Increment RX DLL value
-Read flash ID and check for correctness of data read
-repeat above two steps until a band of passing values is obtained for
RX DLL where flash ID is correctly read.
-DLL needs to set to middle of the passing band.

I am trying to figure out how to fit this into the spi-mem framework as
controller would to need to store READ ID opcode and expected JEDEC ID
before starting calibration sequence.
