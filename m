Okay, then adding that information (stating that this field is used for
both CMD and ADDR cycles) in the comment would be interesting.

I'm not asking you to support multiple chips right now.
What I'm asking here is to dispatch NFC and NAND fields in different
structures:

struct digicolor_nand {
	struct mtd_info		mtd;
	struct nand_chip	nand;

	u32 nand_cs;
	int t_ccs;
}

struct digicolor_nfc {
	struct nand_hw_control	base;
	void __iomem		*regs;
	struct device		*dev;

	unsigned long		clk_rate;

	u32 ale_cmd;
	u32 ale_data;
	int ale_data_bytes;

	/* Only support one NAND for now */
	struct digicolor_nand	nand;
};

You'll keep the same logic except that this separation will be clearly
visible.

Yep, if that's about avoiding over 80 character lines you could define
such a macro:

#define NFC_RDY(flag)		NFC_INT_ ## flag ## _READY

My point is: you should not return 1 if the NAND is not ready,
waiting forever is not what I'm suggesting here, but you should find a
way to return the actual NAND chip R/B status.
If you don't have any solution to do that from your controller then you
might consider relying on the default dev_ready implementation which is
sending a NAND STATUS command to retrieve the R/B status.

What I'll say is in contradiction with what's done in the sunxi
driver :-) (actually I'm considering fixing that), but after taking a
closer look, dev_ready should only return the status of the NAND, and
not wait for the NAND to be ready.
The function responsible for waiting is waitfunc, maybe this is the one
you should overload.

It's a bit more for erase operations (400ms), anyway if you need a
different behavior you should provide your own waitfunc.

That's why putting that in waitfunc would be more appropriate.

I'm not sure to understand here.
There's a difference between:
1/ waiting for a NAND command to be send on the NAND bus
2/ waiting for the NAND to be ready (for DATA read or after a PROGRAM
   operation)

NAND core is taking care of the 2/, but 1/ is your responsibility
(and this is what you have to wait for here).

I don't think so.
IMO, the code duplication induced by this dispatch is quite limited and
improve readability.
But let's stop bike shedding, we'll wait for other reviews to get more
feedback.

Not really, but again, let's wait other reviews before taking any
decision.

Are you sure you have to wait after each readl access (is NFC_DATA
interfaced with a FIFO or directly doing PIO access) ?

Timings are not only related to ONFI chips, and
onfi_timing_mode_default is extracted from the nand_ids table which is
describing non-ONFI chips.

This is not my call to make, but IMHO, dynamic NAND timing
configuration should be mandatory for new drivers.

Yep, this applies to both cases (information extracted from the DT and

That's not my decision to make ;-).
