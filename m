Ok, I change this.

Ok, a proposal for the properties names and values:

>> ecc_mode:
>> NAND_ECC_NONE
>> NAND_ECC_SOFT
>> NAND_ECC_HW
>> NAND_ECC_HW_SYNDROME

"ti,davinci-nand-ecc-mode" = "none", "soft", "hw" or "hw_syndrome"

>> bbt_options:
>> NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH

"ti,davinci-nand-bbt-options" = "use_flash"

>> ecc_bits:
>> 1
>> 4

"ti,davinci-nand-ecc-bits" = "1" or "4"

>> options:
>> NAND_BUSWIDTH_16

"ti,davinci-nand-options" = "buswidth-16"

bye,
Heiko
