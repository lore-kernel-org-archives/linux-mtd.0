Did you read what I wrote?

I can pretty much guarantee that fsck will run the same speed,
regardless of scheduler. And users generally don't care about
ultimate fairness on the device while running fsck...

If you (or someone else) doesn't want to use udev, use whatever
you want. You're doing something heavily customized at that
point anyway, surely this isn't a show stopper.

I agree, we just differ on what we consider the reasonable choice to
be.
