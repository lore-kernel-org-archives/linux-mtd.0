Hi Brian,

Anything blocking in this series?
I was expecting to get it into 4.5, but it's too late now. Could you
consider reviewing it (in order to take it into 4.6 if everything is
OK for you)?

The reason I'd like to get this into Linux rather quickly is because I
want to port the sunxi-nand driver to u-boot, and these randomizer
stuff are required on most sunxi boards.
IOW, u-boot users would not understand if I port a NAND driver that
appears to be useless for their board(s) :-/.

Thanks,

Boris
