I made a fork of the SATA driver for the OX810SE who needs the external DMA
to work since it lacks the SATA-sgdma as used in OX820.
But it seems having Ethernet support would be easy, I can rework it and post it.

Yes, It would be great to sync with the upstream tree at some point, please tell
me how my work could be useful.

I only own a PogoPlug v3 to support the basic OX820, but I will lack hardware to
support PCIe and the dual SATA setup at some point.

The next work I plan to do once the basic OX820 boot is merged is to push the USB,
and the PLL support in the clock driver. The SATA and PCIe would be a natural following work.

Actually I tested only on non-PCIe, since I only own a PogoPlug v3 (non-pro) and the
probe works perfectly on 4.9-rc1 :

Great, thanks for the hints.

I did set up a ML for the upstream work at linux-oxnas@lists.tuxfamily.org and a patchwork interface https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-oxnas/list/ if it can be helpful.

I also idle on #linux-oxnas on freenode...
