Thanks a lot for updating us. Richard, Boris and I have
discussed about this on IRC.

We came to the following conclusions:

1. There's no way to guarantee that the thread will be scheduled
soon enough to always do the data transfer in time.

Using CONFIG_PREEMPT could prevent a timeout in many (most?)
cases, but it's not guaranteed to work.

2. The pxa3xx-nand driver is poorly designed, and it shouldn't
do any data transfer in the IRQ (threaded or not) handler.

Instead, this should be done in {read,write}_buf, i.e. in the
context of the calling process that asks data to be read/write.
This is potentially a big rework.

3. Richard proposed to get rid of the timeout
(using wait_for_completion_interruptible instead?).

I'm wondering if that could avoid these kind of issues (false
timeouts), as a less invasive solution, until someone steps
up to rework the driver.

How does it sound?
