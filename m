Why nomadik_nand.c?
Shouldn't the fsmc_nand.c rule apply also in this case?

Maybe.
But I suspect that may be few differences in the ECC accelerator inside, 
in fact.

In our FSMC previous case it was a Hamming accelerator, and I think this 
apply
also for nomadik (maybe). In our sp1300 case it is a BCH with 104 bytes 
of ECC.

This is one of the options when generating the h/w block, so FSMCs may 
differ.
If we want to re-use same driver I guess we might change something and 
accept
few parameters from the platform.

Vipin can for sure comment more on this.....


Rgds,
Arm
