I don't think BUG() is a good idea, instead what you can do
is force the user of the _new_ feature to _not_ use the keep_config
by overriding the keep_config to 0 and printing a warning
that keep_config is prohibited with multiple chip selects feature and
that it will be disabled.
Of course you will still need to put a comment inside the pxa3xx_nand.h.

No, if you have 2 chips, then certainly you'd better have a separate
structure for the chip description.

What I was wondering, is that there are many places in the patch where
you change the "info" to "nand", may be this can be avoided if you keep
the structure that describes the controller ("pxa3xx_nand" in the patch)
named "pxa3xx_nand_info" and the new structure that describes the chip
will be named something else like pxa3xx_nand_chip or anything like this.
This way, your patch will not have to change the "info" to "nand" in many
places (or maybe even all places) and will be much shorter and will include
only functional changes.

or switch, what ever you like, but please, don't leave it like
if (cs) ..., because this is confusing it has a meaning of "cs is good or bad?",
while actually, you want to know if it is 0 or 1 (both values are good).

Good, my previous explanation also applies here.

Yes, this should be fine, but also don't forget about
pxa3xx_nand_config_flash() function call - it can return 0 or -EINVAL
and it should also propagate instead of being squashed.
