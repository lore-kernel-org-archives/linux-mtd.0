Right, I wasn't recommending removing the depends on
ARCH_UNIPHIER. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

I'm thinking

	menuconfig CLK_UNIPHIER
		bool "Clock drivers for UniPhier SoCs"
		depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER || COMPILE_TEST
		depends on OF
		default ARCH_UNIPHIER

That way we can build it even if we're not the arch, and it's
defaulted to be built if we have the arch enabled, but it isn't
defaulted to be built if that arch isn't enabled and compile test
is enabled.

Sounds like it isn't possible to avoid clock-names DT property
then. Not a big deal.

We've been trying to figure out some way to register clks without
requiring strings, but so far nothing has really happened. The
clk_hw approach would work, except for the case where some of the
provider's clks rely on another provider's clks that also rely on
the first provider (sort of a spiral of dependencies). In that
case we want to break the provider level loop by letting clks say
something besides clk_hw pointers are parents.

Strings work well here because we have support for clock-names
and string based parent-child descriptions already, but maybe
we'd be better off having some way to say that this clk we're
registering uses provider X's 24th output as its second parent.
It would be good if we avoided tying it to any DT construct
though, because DT isn't the only way clks are registered and
provided to the system.

This is all because we know that forcing driver authors to come
up with globally unique names for clks just doesn't work when it
comes to things like the same clk controller IP instantiated
twice in the hardware and thus the same driver matches both
device instances.
