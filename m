The patch makes the m25p80 could supports the Quad read.
it is okay if the quad-read mode set fails.

For the Quadspi driver, if the quad read mode set failed, it will still
run in the Fast Read mode.

do you need a warning when the quad read set fails?

sorry, could you explain a little more? how can make the DT seems more
appropriate ?

thanks

it is the other driver's responsibility to add the bits info or the
dummy info to the m25p80 code.

dido.

you can submit a patch to fix this issue if your SPI controller can not
works on this patch.

It is over-design for this patch set to add the bits info/dummy info to
the m25p80 code.
