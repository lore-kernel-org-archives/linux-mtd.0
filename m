I want to use this driver for ARM-based UniPhier SoCs.
Their DT files are located as follows:

arch/arm/boot/dts/uniphier-*
arch/arm64/boot/dts/socionext/uniphier-*


If we decided to add new DT compatible strings rather than DT property,
which string would you suggest?
Should it include "denali" or just SoC name "uniphier-*"?
How about the vendor prefix?  "denali," or "socionext," ?


like this?  I am not sure...


nand: nand@68000000 {
        compatible = "socionext,uniphier-pro5-nand", "denali,denali-nand-dt";
        reg-names = "nand_data", "denali_reg";
        reg = <0x68000000 0x20>, <0x68100000 0x1000>;
        interrupts = <0 65 4>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_nand>;
        clocks = <&nandclk>;
};


At least, I need two DT compatible strings,
for old/new "n_banks" encoding.

The following part is also a problem for me because
platform-specific ECC bit is hard-coded in the driver.

The comment claims that Intel MRST supports 8bit and 15bit for ecc.strenth,
while the Denali IP on UniPhier SoCs supports 8bit, 16bit, and 24bit ECC.

I need to do something with it to proceed, but the code is crappy.


        /*
         * Denali Controller only support 15bit and 8bit ECC in MRST,
         * so just let controller do 15bit ECC for MLC and 8bit ECC for
         * SLC if possible.
         * */
        if (!nand_is_slc(&denali->nand) &&
                        (mtd->oobsize > (denali->bbtskipbytes +
                        ECC_15BITS * (mtd->writesize /
                        ECC_SECTOR_SIZE)))) {
                /* if MLC OOB size is large enough, use 15bit ECC*/
                denali->nand.ecc.strength = 15;
                denali->nand.ecc.layout = &nand_15bit_oob;
                denali->nand.ecc.bytes = ECC_15BITS;
                iowrite32(15, denali->flash_reg + ECC_CORRECTION);
        } else if (mtd->oobsize < (denali->bbtskipbytes +
                        ECC_8BITS * (mtd->writesize /
                        ECC_SECTOR_SIZE))) {
                pr_err("Your NAND chip OOB is not large enough to
contain 8bit ECC correction codes");
                goto failed_req_irq;
        } else {
                denali->nand.ecc.strength = 8;
                denali->nand.ecc.layout = &nand_8bit_oob;
                denali->nand.ecc.bytes = ECC_8BITS;
                iowrite32(8, denali->flash_reg + ECC_CORRECTION);
        }
