Your patch prefix says "v1", so I'm assuming this is the first public
version. I'm sure you spent a lot of time developing this driver
internally, but no matter how long it took, it's a first version for
us, and since we are moving away from the spi_nor controller interface,
I'm not willing to accept new drivers using this interface.

If you want more background about the spi_nor controller interface
deprecation, you can read [1].

Actually, I'd like to do it the other way around: let you rework the
driver to implement the spi-mem interface and review this version.
Otherwise I'll be reviewing things I don't intend to merge anyway.

Didn't go through the code in details, but at first glance, it looks
like it would fit pretty well.

We recently converted the atmel QSPI driver [2].
