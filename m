The link leads to altera documentation front page, but I have an idea
what you mean. You might want to refer to [2] instead.

[2] https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/hb/cyclone-v/cv_5v4.pdf

The altera docs, page 993, show how to use the direct access mode. The
idea is to map 1 MiB blocks of the flash in the address space, one at a
time and then do IO into those. I don't like such solution:

- I didn't find any way to find when all the data in the current 1 MiB
  block were written and you can remap another 1 MiB block in place.
- Since the controller doesn't use the internal buffer in direct
  operation mode, it will block the AHB bus during it's operation.
- I didn't find how IO errors get handled in this case, but maybe I
  didn't drill deep enough on this one.

Moreover, page 991 bottom of [2] states that the indirect mode is
"high-performance". I am inclined to believe that as it uses the
internal buffer of the QSPI controller, which is tightly coupled to the
block,
so the data are available immediately when the flash is ready instead
of having to wait for the next AHB turn.

My impression is that the Direct mode is great when the system boots
from the QSPI because it can "map" the flash and just execute code from
it. But for normal operation, the indirect mode seems the better choice.

I haven't tested it, no.
