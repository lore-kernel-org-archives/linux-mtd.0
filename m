Yes, if we could change the hardware (ROM is hardware) there are various
things we could do to improve reliability.
What we want to do in devicetree is to describe the (unchangeable)
hardware so that Linux can work with it as well as possible.

If I have hardware that doesn't reset the flash on reset, then labeling
it
  doesnt-reset-flash-on-system-reset
is perfectly appropriate.  Labeling it "broken" is pejorative and unhelpful.

I cannot say for certain if I read your last response, but I've read
quite a few opinions while researching this and think I have a good
handle on the details.

I agree that if you want high reliability then you need a properly
configured hardware watchdog.  Not everyone needs that and not everyone
bothers with a watchdog.
If you do want a watchdog, you would (obviously?) make sure to buy
hardware that supports a watchdog.
But if you choose to buy hardware that doesn't have a watchdog, then it
isn't "broken", it simply doesn't have a watchdog and so can be expected
to freeze if something particularly bad happens.

Linux could get almost arbitrarily sophisticated in ensuring that
the panic-handling code was fully robust and was stored in
write-protected memory, and so be able to reboot cleanly after any
panic.
There will, of course, be situations where it cannot recover (it might
not panic...), but the fact that it needs to reset the flash as part of
recovery shouldn't increase the set of such situations noticeably.

Is it really our job to help people figure out what's wrong with their
designs (unless they ask)?
I see it as our job to make Linux work reliably.
If a system hangs on reboot, but we can fix reboot so that it doesn't, I
think we should.  Clearly you disagree.

To clearly state my position:
1/ A clean reboot should reboot cleanly, resetting any hardware that
   might need resetting.
2/ an unclean reboot is never guaranteed (though "best effort" is still
   a good goal).  If you need guaranteed unclean reboots, you need a
   properly configured hardware watchdog.

My hardware doesn't have a properly configured hardware watchdog, and I
don't expect it to handle an unclean reboot.  I do expect it to handle a
clean reboot.  I'd rather not be told the hardware is "broken" because
it isn't - it simply doesn't have watchdog support (it doesn't have
hardware floating point either - that doesn't make it 'broken').

Thanks,
NeilBrown
