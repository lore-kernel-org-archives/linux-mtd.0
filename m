If possible, I'd prefer to make a stronger claim, at least for the key material.
We are very careful with how we manage the keys in the kernel, and I'd consider
any timing attack against the keys to be a bug --- and I expect that other
people would too.

Data is a different story though, since ultimately it is used by applications to
actually do something.

We could mention that a filesystem containing encrypted files can be "hidden" by
unmounting it, though that should be obvious.  It's also possible to hide
individual files or directories by bind-mounting stuff over them, though that is
getting somewhat eccentric; usually mode bits, ACLs, etc. would be used instead.

That falls under the category of "physical attack".

So far you're the only person who has reviewed the patchset in detail.  I've
tried to get more people interested, but it has been difficult.  Perhaps the new
documentation will help people understand the problems that the patchset solves.
Being able to provide the wrong key for another user's encrypted files is a
security vulnerability, so we *have* to fix it eventually.

Well, I think there are higher priorities right now, but if we want to start
that conversation we'd first need to send the updated version of the patchset
which implements the latest version of the algorithm
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cope-heh-01) and has been rebased onto the
latest kernel.

It is too late for v4.14 since that merge window is already open.  It could
potentially go into v4.15, though as a prerequisite for that I expect that Ted
would like to see more people review/discuss it first.  Note that we do not want
to rush it, since we will be locked into the new on-disk format once merged.
