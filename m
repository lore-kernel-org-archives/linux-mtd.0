I don't want to force everybody to use udev, use whatever you like on
your platform. For most people that is udev, for embedded it's something
else. As you said, distros already do this via udev. When I've had to
do it on my systems, I've added a udev rule to do it.

My opinion is that the kernel makes various schedulers available.
Deciding which one to use is policy that should go into user space.
The default should be something that's solid and works, fancier
setups and tuning should be left to user space.
