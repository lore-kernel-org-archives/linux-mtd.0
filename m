^^ Ah, so this is what I was struggling with at first. I agree that
Micron looks broken. Quite possibly Macronix too. Unfortunately, I
haven't had great test hardware for some of the quad modes. Especially
not anything that supports generic SPI, and not completely on mainline.

It's not clear to me how you're being safe with the dummy cycles at all.
It seems like you're introducing new values that may be incompatible
with drivers. That can be OK, but you have to give drivers a chance to
opt-out... Maybe some kind of "host capability" flags?

That's quite a lot to do in one patch, both in number of lines of code,
and in number of tasks outlined in the commit description. Can this be
broken down at all to be more modular and incremental?

Snipped the rest of the patch for now.
