OK, fair points.  I'm not sure what to say about endianness though.  
Host byte order accesses are used in the driver so can I just specify 
this?  We could add a property later to support endianess swapping, but 
I don't want to add too much that I can't test.

Hmm, I'm not convinced there - the sync is to protect against bus 
ordering, and a read from the right region does that.  I'm working on 
another ARM platform (not PXA) that needs this sync so sure it's not PXA 
specific.

The alternative is to not have this specified in the binding and have 
the platform attach the resource.  On my platform for example I need to 
read from the GPIO controller registers and I can't find a way to 
express this when using ranges...

OK, I guess this can be relaxed to any value.

OK.

OK, not the best example, it just needs to be at least 2 bytes.  I'll 
update it with a better one.
