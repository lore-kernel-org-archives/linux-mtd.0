Out of curiosity, does anybody know of any specific attacks that =
authenticated
encryption for disk encryption would solve as opposed to just using =
encryption
with AES-XTS?

To my knowledge the XTS mode is frowned upon [1], but I don't know of =
any
serious flaws that would eg. allow an attacker to modify file contents
without a *serious* amount of effort. CBC is another story though [2].

Don't get me wrong, I'd like to have authenticated encryption too.
In fact we are currently working on a concept for adding authentication =
to
UBIFS (I'll share more details as soon as its in a presentable state).
However, the reason for this is mainly because UBIFS does *not* operate =
on
the block layer, so dm-integrity/dm-verity is not an option and fscrypt
only protects the confidentiality of file contents and filenames.
This means that the filesystem index is unprotected which makes it =
rather
easy to move files around - eg. replace /bin/bash with something =
completely
different without knowing the fscrypt master key or any derived key.

For the general use case though (eg. securing *really important* files =
on my desktop),
I'd use authenticated encryption at a higher layer to get more =
flexibility
to eg. easily use explicit IVs over implicit ones derived from =
block/sector
number. But maybe there are some uses cases I didn't think of just =
now... :)
