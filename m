The DT can be a lie versus the code. The DT should reflect how the
hardware is wired, afaik, if we take shortcuts in the driver code, that
is fine. If we don't support a certain configuration right now (e.g.
second NAND chip), the driver can just return an appropriate error code.

I agree with both of you. I don't see much value implementing multi-NAND
chip support, especially with different configurations, at the moment. I
am not aware of any hardware making use of that now.

I will update the driver to parse a NAND sub node and get the ECC
properties from the per flash configuration. However, I won't add chip
select or multi-NAND support right now...

Any objection?
