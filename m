Well, the original problem happened specifically for the case that doesn't
have a 64-bit bus transaction (building for ARMv4). If we define
readq_relaxed, it has to be an inline assembly, in order to work for
drivers that require an atomic transaction, so that would have the
same problem. We are a bit inconsistent here though: most 32-bit
architectures have no readq, parisc has one that does two 32-bit accesses,
sh relies on the compiler, and tile apparently has a native instruction.

It seems reasonable to replace the inline assembly in this driver with
a new function as a cleanup, but then how do you want to solve the case
of building a combined armv4/v5 kernel?
