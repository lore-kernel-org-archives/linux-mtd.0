+Unauthorized file access
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+After an encryption key has been added, fscrypt does not hide the
+plaintext file contents or filenames from other users on the same
+system.  Instead, existing access control mechanisms such as file mode
+bits, POSIX ACLs, LSMs, or namespaces should be used for this purpose.
+
+(For the reasoning behind this, understand that while the key is
+added, the confidentiality of the data, from the perspective of the
+system itself, is *not* protected by the mathematical properties of
+encryption but rather only by the correctness of the kernel.
+Therefore, any encryption-specific access control checks would merely
+be enforced by kernel *code* and therefore would be largely redundant
+with the wide variety of access control mechanisms already available.)
+
+Kernel compromise
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+An attacker who compromises the system enough to read from arbitrary
+memory, e.g. by mounting a physical attack or by exploiting a kernel
+security vulnerability, can compromise all encryption keys that are
+currently in use.
+
+However, fscrypt does allow an encryption key to be removed from the
+kernel, which may protect it from later compromise.
+
+In more detail, the FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY ioctl will wipe a
+master encryption key from kernel memory.  Moreover, it will try to
+evict all cached inodes which had been "unlocked" using the key,
+thereby wiping their derived encryption keys and making them once
+again appear "locked", i.e. in ciphertext or encrypted form.
+
+However, FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY has some limitations:
+
+- Derived keys for in-use files will *not* be removed or wiped.
+  Therefore, for maximum effect, userspace should close the relevant
+  encrypted files and directories before removing a master key, as
+  well as kill any processes whose working directory is in an affected
+  encrypted directory.
+
+- The kernel cannot magically wipe copies of the master key(s) that
+  userspace might have as well.  Therefore, userspace must wipe all
+  copies of the master key(s) it makes as well.  Naturally, the same
+  also applies to all higher levels in the key hierarchy, e.g. to all
+  key(s) that are used to wrap or derive the fscrypt master keys.
+  Userspace should also follow other security precautions such as
+  mlock()ing memory containing keys to prevent it from being swapped
+  out.
+
+- In general, decrypted contents and filenames in the kernel VFS
+  caches are freed but not wiped.  Therefore, portions thereof may be
+  recoverable from freed memory, even after the corresponding key(s)
+  were wiped.  To partially solve this, you may enable page poisoning
+  by enabling CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING in your kernel config and adding
+  page_poison=1 to your kernel command line.  However, that has a
+  performance cost.
+
+- Secret keys might still exist in CPU registers, in crypto
+  accelerator hardware (if used by the crypto API to provide any of
+  the algorithms), or in other places not explicitly considered here.
+
+Limitations of v1 policies
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The original encryption policy version (which we call "v1") had some
+weaknesses with respect to online attacks:
+
+- There was no verification that the provided master key was correct.
+  Therefore, malicious users could associate the wrong key with
+  encrypted files, even files to which they had only read-only access.
+
+- A compromise of any file's derived encryption key also compromised
+  the master key it was derived from.
+
+- Non-root users could not securely remove encryption keys.
+
+All the above problems are fixed with v2 encryption policies
+(:c:type:`fscrypt_policy_v2`).  For this reason, it's recommended to
+use v2 encryption policies for all new encrypted directories.

+A different KDF is used depending on the encryption policy version:
+
+For v1 encryption policies, the KDF is somewhat ad-hoc: we encrypt the

+key, and the resulting ciphertext is used as the derived key.  If the

+For v2 encryption policies, the KDF is HKDF-SHA512.  HKDF is preferred
+to the AES-based KDF because HKDF is standardized and has a number of
+desirable properties such as being nonreversible and evenly
+distributing the entropy from the master key.  To derive a file's
+encryption key using HKDF, the master key is used as the "input key
+material", a fixed value is used as the "salt", and the file's 16-byte
+nonce prefixed with a context byte is used as the

+The FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY ioctl can be used to remove a master
+encryption key from the kernel, wiping the corresponding secrets from
+memory and causing any files which were "unlocked" with the key to
+appear "locked" again.  It takes in a pointer to a :c:type:`struct
+fscrypt_remove_key_args`, defined as follows::
+
+    struct fscrypt_remove_key_args {
+            __u32 flags;
+    #define FSCRYPT_REMOVE_KEY_FLAG_ALL_USERS       0x00000001
+            __u32 reserved1;
+            __u64 reserved2[2];
+            struct fscrypt_key_specifier key_spec;
+    };
+
+This structure must be initialized as follows:
+
+- ``flags`` can contain the following flags:
+
+    - ``FSCRYPT_REMOVE_KEY_FLAG_ALL_USERS`` specifies that the key
+      should be removed even if it has also been added by other users.
+      Specifying this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
+      the initial user namespace.
+
+- The key to remove is specified by ``key_spec``:
+
+    - To remove a key used by v1 encryption policies, set
+      ``key_spec.type`` to FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR and fill
+      in ``key_spec.descriptor``.  To remove this type of key, the
+      calling process must have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the
+      initial user namespace.
+
+    - To remove a key used by v2 encryption policies, set
+      ``key_spec.type`` to FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_IDENTIFIER and fill
+      in ``key_spec.identifier``.  To remove this type of key, no
+      privileges are needed.  However, users can only remove keys that
+      they added themselves, subject to privileged override with
+      FSCRYPT_REMOVE_KEY_FLAG_ALL_USERS.
+
+- All reserved fields must be zeroed.
+
+FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY can fail with the following errors:
+
+- ``EACCES``: The FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR key specifier type
+  and/or the FSCRYPT_REMOVE_KEY_FLAG_ALL_USERS flag was specified, but
+  the caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the initial
+  user namespace
+- ``EBUSY``: the master key secret was wiped from memory, but some
+  files which were unlocked with it are still in use.  Such files
+  could not be locked, nor could their per-file keys be wiped from
+  memory.  The ioctl may be retried later to re-attempt locking the
+  remaining files.
+- ``EINVAL``: invalid flags or key specifier type, or reserved bits
+  were set
+- ``ENOKEY``: the key is not present or has already been removed
+- ``ENOTTY``: this type of filesystem does not implement encryption
+- ``EOPNOTSUPP``: the kernel was not configured with encryption
+  support for this filesystem, or the filesystem superblock has not
+  had encryption enabled on it
+- ``EUSERS``: the key cannot be removed because other users have added
+  it too
+
+Before using this ioctl, please read the `Kernel compromise`_ section
+for a discussion of the security goals and limitations of this ioctl.
+
+Getting key status
+------------------
+
+The FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS ioctl retrieves the status of a
+master encryption key.  It takes in a pointer to a :c:type:`struct
+fscrypt_get_key_status_args`, defined as follows::
+
+    struct fscrypt_get_key_status_args {
+            /* input */
+            __u64 reserved1[3];
+            struct fscrypt_key_specifier key_spec;
+
+            /* output */
+            __u32 status;
+    #define FSCRYPT_KEY_STATUS_ABSENT               1
+    #define FSCRYPT_KEY_STATUS_PRESENT              2
+    #define FSCRYPT_KEY_STATUS_INCOMPLETELY_REMOVED 3
+            __u32 status_flags;
+    #define FSCRYPT_KEY_STATUS_FLAG_ADDED_BY_SELF   0x00000001
+            __u32 user_count;
+            __u32 reserved2;
+            __u64 reserved3[6];
+    };
+
+The caller must zero ``reserved1``, then fill in ``key_spec``:
+
+    - To get the status of a key for v1 encryption policies, set
+      ``key_spec.type`` to FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR and fill
+      in ``key_spec.descriptor``.
+
+    - To get the status of a key for v2 encryption policies, set
+      ``key_spec.type`` to FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_IDENTIFIER and fill
+      in ``key_spec.identifier``.
+
+On success, 0 is returned and the kernel fills in the output fields:
+
+- ``status`` indicates whether the key is absent, present, or
+  incompletely removed.  Incompletely removed means that the master
+  secret has been removed, but some files are still in use; i.e.,
+  FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY returned EBUSY.
+
+- ``status_flags`` can contain the following flags:
+
+    - ``FSCRYPT_KEY_STATUS_FLAG_ADDED_BY_SELF`` indicates that the key
+      has added by the current user.  This is only set for keys
+      identified by ``identifier`` rather than by ``descriptor``.
+
+- ``user_count`` specifies the number of users who have added the key.
+  This is only set for keys identified by ``identifier`` rather than
+  by ``descriptor``.
+
+FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS can fail with the following errors:
+
+- ``EINVAL``: invalid key specifier type, or reserved bits were set
+- ``ENOTTY``: this type of filesystem does not implement encryption
+- ``EOPNOTSUPP``: the kernel was not configured with encryption
+  support for this filesystem, or the filesystem superblock has not
+  had encryption enabled on it
+
+Among other use cases, FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS might be
+useful for determining whether the key for a given encrypted directory
+needs to be added before prompting the user for the passphrase needed
+to derive the key.
+
+FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS can only get the status of keys in
+the filesystem-level keyring, i.e. the keyring managed by
+FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY and FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY.  It cannot
+get the status of a key that has only been added for use by v1
+encryption policies using the legacy mechanism involving
+process-subscribed keyrings.
