I guess you're referring to this hunk from patch 4/4?

-       /* Deprecated since 3.11-rc2 */
+       /* Deprecated since 3.11-rc2, should be removed around 3.17 */

This hunk really seems out of place in patch 4. If you even want this
change, it should go in with patch 1. I don't see how it is related to
patch 4.

But the key point is that I don't think you should try to detect (and
print notices about) the bank-width property at all. As long as the
documentation clearly states that it is optional (and that some
systems may autodetect it), I think that is sufficient not to print
any warnings. You should consider that some user may want to retain
this DT binding for some other non-Linux OS (or for some range of new
and old kernel versions) so that they need this bank-width property.

Another way to look at this is that it doesn't hurt Linux at all for
there to be an extra DT property for a device. But it can hurt the
bootloader if it needs to support other OS's/drivers that don't
autodetect bank-width property.

On the other hand, if you're going to include this kind of
schedule-related comment at all, then it should at least be correct. I
can tell you a few things for sure:
(1) This code is not going into any of the 3.11 release candidates
(2) It doesn't really make sense to a user to see references to "-rc2"
when reading Linux source code. That's very much a process-related
detail that should not go in here.
