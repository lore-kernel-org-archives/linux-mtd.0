Issue 2 is always an issue when reading an erased page with hardware
ECC.  So we have,

                    Main         Spare
    Good program:   Data    OOB-data+HW-ECC
    Good erased:    FF      FF  FF
    Stuck erased1:  FF      FF  xx
    Stuck erased2:  xx      xx  FF

For the 'good erased' the controller goes about like it is case 'good
program'.  It reads a sector (raw read or software ECC case) and a the
same time, the error corrector is running.  This examines the 'OOB
data', which is 0xff for the erased sector and it blindly begins to
apply the error correction to the main data section.  The 'correction'
for an erased block will always flip '1' to '0'.  So for 'good erased',
the 'error_count' will equal the flipped bits.

Now, your sectors aren't that bad.  I believe you only have one bit
error on an erase.  However, it is really hairy to know what the ECC
logic will do when you have bit flips in the ECC code.  It is also next
to impossible to examine the buffer and know if zero bits are due to the
ECC engine flipping the bits and/or the actual physical flash having the
stuck bit.  It appears that the ECC engine runs from start to finish.
So most of the ECC corrections should be at the start; use this info for
diagnostics, but not coding!

The best course IMHO is to do what Brian (and other) did and do a 'raw'
read, so you take the ECC engine out of the picture and stop it from
flipping bits.  You can experiment with always doing the raw read, but I
believe you will see a decrease in performance (as others mentioned and
I saw).

Well, it is everyone.  Sorry, I made the assumption this wouldn't
happen, but apparently it does.

Hmm.  No, it should be ok; I think Brian meant we should accept and
expect this.  We had this conversation after the RFC.  However, we
should probably only accept strength/2 zero values at most; I believe
what to accept was kind of hanging in that conversation.  If the zeros
are below our threshold with a raw read, then we can report the page is
all '\xff' and return a 'bit flip' count as the number of zeros found in
a raw read.  Also, in the 'all FFs' case we should probably memset the
OOB data.  I see that other patches mentioned in the MTD threads above
do this.

 +	if (flip > ecc_count) {

 +           ecc_count =3D count_zero_bits();

 +
 +	/* Erased page. */
 +	memset(dat, 0xff, nfc->chip.ecc.size);
 +	memset(oob, 0xff, ???);  /* ??? */
 +	return ecc_count;

I don't think that UBI/UbiFs use the OOB data at all, but that is
something that I don't think is completely correct in this path?

Arg.  I am not quite sure.  It seems ok to have a few 'stuck at one'
errors.  As you move closer to the ECC strength this seems a little
crazy.  At some point the sector/erase block is becoming useless.  I am
not sure if this is an issue with this device; it seems a little
suspect.  Maybe you could code something that emulates the stuck bits on
a good device and see if it still behaves the same; triggers a software
condition.  You might also reduce the NFC bus clock just to see on the
'stuck zero' device.

Hth,
