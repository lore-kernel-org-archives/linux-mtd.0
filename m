w/o the patch, you can write data to the flash using userland tools from
mtd-utils package (flash_erase and nandwrite); data can then be read
again using userland tools (say using dd). But - as reported by Ben - if
you nandwrite an uImage from userland, here is what you indeed get from
u-boot when you try and boot that image:

  root@humble:~# flash_erase /dev/mtd2 0 0
  Erasing 128 Kibyte @ 5e0000 -- 100 % complete 
  
  root@humble:~# nandwrite -p /dev/mtd2 /tmp/uImage-3.16.1.rn102
  Writing data to block 0 at offset 0x0
  Writing data to block 1 at offset 0x20000
  Writing data to block 2 at offset 0x40000
  Writing data to block 3 at offset 0x60000
  Writing data to block 4 at offset 0x80000
  
  ...
  
  reboot 
  
  ...
  
  Marvell>> nand read 0x1200000 0x200000 0x600000

     Verifying Checksum ... Bad Data CRC
  ERROR: can't get kernel image!
  

Now, w/ the patch submitted by Ben, here is what you get:

  With the patch applied, this indeed works has 
  ## Booting kernel from Legacy Image at 01200000 ...
     Image Name:   Linux-3.16.1.rn102
     Created:      2014-09-05  20:25:34 UTC

     Entry Point:  00008000
     Verifying Checksum ... OK
     Loading Kernel Image ... OK
  OK
  
  Starting kernel ...

i.e. it works.  

So, thanks for reporting this, Ben. I must confess I got used to update
my kernels from u-boot and did not take enough attention to that
aspect when I updated the .dts to add access to NAND after Ezequiel
wrote the NAND driver. I will take a look at RN104 and RN2120 to check
if something similar is needed for those two.

FWIW, you can add my:

Additionally, Ezequiel, would anything prevent pushing the patch to
stable team (nand entry in .dts was added in 3.14):

 Fixes: 92beaccd8b49 ("ARM: mvebu: Enable NAND controller in ReadyNAS 102 .dts file")

Cheers,
