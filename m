This is not really helpful.

So you want me and everyone else and everyone on embedded to mess with
udev? No, thanks.

There are people booting with init=3D/bin/bash, too, running fsck. Would
not it be nice to use reasonable schedulers there?

Kernel should do reasonable thing by default, and it seems to be easy
in this case.

You keep repeating "but someone's super fast raid might get slowed
down". Those 5 people in the world probably already have their udev
rules.

Now, lets do the right thing by default for the rest of the world,
including you.
