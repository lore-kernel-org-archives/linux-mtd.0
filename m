Yes, it *can* be done. Previously, we couldn't do this, because any
change there would also change the ABI, which is off limits, but I fixed
that by separating the 'nand_ecclayout' and 'nand_ecclayout_user'
structs. That still doesn't make it preferable. These structs are
getting pretty big, and they hold a very low density of information...

If you actually need to know this info from user space, then you need to
define a new interface to expose that. The existing one is legacy, and
it is insufficient for most modern use cases. It won't work for you.

Other mechanisms can already help you though. For one, auto-placed OOB
(e.g., 'nandwrite --autoplace') can let the MTD layer automatically put
your data into the available spare area.

Why do you need to access the spare area anyway? Modern NAND filesystems
shouldn't really be storing anything there anyway.
