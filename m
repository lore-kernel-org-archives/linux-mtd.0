What's the meaning of "power-cycle"?
I only tested with the soft reset, the power is never shut down.

With your patch, we have resetted the BCH twice in the driver. Could
we only reset BCH one time?
Do you ever remove another reset-bch code, and test it?
Frankly speaking, it's strange to reset the BCH twice, and it makes no sens=
e. :(
I am afraid that we have to add three-reset-bch in the future, if we
can not find the root cause.
If you can remove another reset-bch code, i will ack the patch.

I ever met the same case with the freescale's BSP code.
I fixed the issue in uboot, and fixed the driver too.

At the beginning? it's really interesting.
I want to test it myself.

could you wait for some time?
