I feel a contradiction in this counter-argument. On one hand, there are 
lots of, let's call them, home users, that use major distributions with 
udev, so the distribution maintainers can reasonably decide which 
scheduler to use for which type of device based on the udev rule and 
common sense provided via Documentation/ by linux-block devs. Moreover, 
most likely, those rules should be similar or the same across all the 
major distros and available via some (systemd?) upstream.

On another hand, the users of embedded devices, mentioned by Linus, 
should already know what scheduler to choose because dealing with 
embedded world assumes the person can decide this on their own, or with 
the help of abovementioned udev scripts and/or Documentation/ as a 
reference point.

So I see no obstacles here, and the choice to rely on udev by default 
sounds reasonable.

The question that remain is whether it is really important to mount a 
root partition while already using some specific scheduler? Why it 
cannot be done with "none", for instance?

And that's why major distributions are likely to default to BFQ via 
udev. No one argues with BFQ superiority here ☺.

 From my point of view this is not a conservative approach at all. On 
contrary, offloading decisions to userspace aligns pretty well with 
recent trends like pressure metrics/userspace OOM killer, eBPF etc. The 
less unnecessary logic the kernel handles, the more flexibility it 
affords.
