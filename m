For the TI SPI controller this is programmable. So instead of
composing a SPI message that sends the opcode (and address and dummy
bytes) you set the opcode in a controller register and then perform
the memory read which sends the configured opcode to the flash memory.
So this needs to be exposed in an API which the m25p80 driver can use.

Presumably when you have a function in SPI core for this it takes the
same lock transfer_one does so either you do mmap transfer or normal
SPI transfer. You can probably manually sync on transfer completion in
a driver that uses both normal SPI messages and mmap transfer - which
m25p80 does anyway.
