OK, that seems better.

Property spi-3write means some controllers only have cs, clk and
sda(SI/SO shared) 3 wires. So if spi-3wire is set, then dual and quad
set should be forbidden. I didn't mean that spi-3wire can't be present
together with spi-tx/rx-num-wires, if set to <1> it's OK. Just can't
be <2 | 4>(dual and quad).
