Ans-1: Yes, I'm testing on following boards:
  (a) AM335x-EVM which has x8 Micron device.
  http://www.ti.com/tool/tmdxevm3358
  (b) beaglebone with 'NAND cape', which has x16 Micron device.
  http://beagleboardtoys.info/index.php?title=3DBeagleBone_4Gb_16-Bit_NAND_=
Module
  (c) AM437x board (which has 4K page NAND from Macronix).
  (d) Also would be testing on DRA7xx again having Micron Device.

Ans-2:
Its not the setup but rather constrain in nand_base.c which prevents
reading of ONFI params in x16 mode. Please read below..

Ans-3:
Mostly are either x8 or x16 SLC NAND device.

So, here comes the conflict..=20
If I'm _not_ using NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO, how should I read the ONFI=20
params on x16 device ? I don't think there is any way because of following
code in generic nand_base.c
@@ nand_flash_onfi_detect()
/*
 * ONFI must be probed in 8-bit mode or with NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO, not
 * with NAND_BUSWIDTH_16
 */
if (chip->options & NAND_BUSWIDTH_16) {
	pr_err("ONFI cannot be probed in 16-bit mode; aborting\n");
	return 0;
}

Introduced in commit..
commit 0ce82b7f7b7373b16ecf7b5725e21e2975204500
Author:     Matthieu CASTET <matthieu.castet@parrot.com>
AuthorDate: 2013-01-16

And, I think this commit has implicitly made NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO
*mandatory* to be supported by every driver for interfacing with
x16 NAND devices. Isn't it ?
(unless you add every x16 device present in market to nand_flash_id[])

For a x16 device.. This would *always* fail for x16 device, unless device
is listed in nand_flash_id[]. isn't  it ?
because you cannot read ONFI params in x16 mode, and your device is
not listed in nand_flash_ids[], so your device would not get identified.

And I sincerely don't know how other NAND drivers are probing
x16 NAND devices _without_ enabling NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO.
(may be by adding every supported NAND device to nand_flash_id[]
look-up table, which is not recommended).

>=20
chip->cmdfunc() and chip->readbufs() are all fine. Rather I let the
generic driver set them for nand_scan_ident().
So, all this calling nand_scan_ident() twice was done because of
previously mentioned reasons..

>=20
It's a chicken and egg problem,=20
I have no solution but all I can say is the above commit, which converted
WARNING into ERROR, until all drivers adapt to NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO.

Anyway I have to do nand_scan_ident() somewhere before populating
the chip->ecc.layout and other fields.. so can't drop the patch..
But I'll put your suggestion, instead of my mine.

>=20
I'll replace the patch with your suggestions,
So, that you have both versions. Please pick whichever you like :-)
