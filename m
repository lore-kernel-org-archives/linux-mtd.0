Hmm, after thinking about it more, my claim that creating intentional collisions
in digested names requires write access to the raw disk is incorrect.  Actually
it's pretty easy to create intentional collisions; it's sufficient to be able to
create filenames and view their corresponding ciphertexts.  So someone could
create undeletable files --- not necessarily the end of the world, but still
annoying.

Unfortunately, the same problem exists regardless of whether we use the
second-to-last ciphertext block, the last block, or the last two blocks; and
regardless of whether the length is encoded in the digested names.

My patches are still an improvement, of course, and for now I'll probably just
tweak the comment.  But to solve this for real I think we'd need to do one of
the following:

- Use a real cryptographic hash like SHA-256 of the ciphertext (which I think
  was actually the original design)
- Switch to an encryption mode like HEH (Hash-Encrypt-Hash) which is a
  pseudorandom permutation over the whole input
- Take some number (maybe 8 or 12) of bytes of ciphertext from each block;
  definitely a hack cryptographically, but it *might* be good enough
- Limit filenames in encrypted directories to (3*255)/4 bytes, so we can avoid
  this mess entirely

Another hack we maybe could do is remove the following sanity check in
ext4_unlink(), and in other filesystems if needed, which requires that the inode
number in a dir_entry being removed is as expected:

	retval = -EFSCORRUPTED;
	if (le32_to_cpu(de->inode) != inode->i_ino)
		goto end_unlink;

Then I think any colliding files could still be deleted; it just wouldn't happen
in the right order...
