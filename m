No problem.

As said in my previous reply, it's not just about returning an error. I
had a closer look at the code, and it seems that using
__get_mtd_device() properly should prevent the problem we are talking
about (call __get_mtd_device() after your nvmem_register() and call
__put_mtd_device() only if nvmem_unregister() succeed).

That's a different problem, and I'm not sure I like the idea of
changing the ->add() prototype into

	void *(*add)(struct mtd_info *);

If we want to do that, I'd rather see an API extension allowing one to
attach/detach/query/update user data to an MTD device.
