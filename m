So it can be in <linux/mfd/my-sysconfig-regs.h> as
a

#define MY_SYSCON_V1_BOOT_DEV_REG 0x958
#define MY_SYSCON_V1_BOOT_DEV_SPI 0x1a

The kernel should know which SoC is in use and
act apropriately right?

But indeed, what you're doing has been done before
in drivers/regulator/anatop-regulator.c where some
register offset is read in from the attribute
"anatop-delay-reg-offset". So it may be that the DT people
need to overrule me on this one :-)

I don't think we should hard-code knowledge of specific
register locations into the device tree at all as that makes
things very hard to debug.
