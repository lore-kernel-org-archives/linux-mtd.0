I am in favor for a mainline inclusion through linux-mtd tree.

On the AT91 side, we will have to take this inclusion into account to
avoid merge conflicts... But as long as this cleanup is not ready yet, I
prefer to go forward this way.

For that purpose, that would be good to see this patch in linux-next.

Thanks to all of you, bye,
