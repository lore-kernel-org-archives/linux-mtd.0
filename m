Hi Michael,

Mention 'mv' as an example to make it more concrete?

There are arguments in favor of this, but I'm worried that people will think
they can encrypt their files by "moving" them into an encrypted directory.  In
fact, the unencrypted data will still be on-disk in the free blocks.  When
people say they want 'mv' to work, do they actually understand that it usually
defeats the purpose of encryption?  Or are they naively assuming that deleting a
file means its data is gone forever?

In any case, if we actually do this we'd need to document that mv-ing files into
an encrypted directory is a bad idea, although it would be of limited use since
users rarely read documentation.

Nits for if we do end up doing this: remove "cross-rename" from the subjects to
shorten them a bit (cross-rename is a type of rename), then add more detail to
the patch descriptions, even if that requires duplicating some text.  The cover
letter doesn't get recorded in the commit history, only the actual commits do.

Note: I'm also working on a patchset which adds helper functions
fscrypt_prepare_link() and fscrypt_prepare_rename().  After that, this error
will be chosen by the shared code, rather than individual filesystems.

Eric
