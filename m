Hmm, would you please show why my binary file 'nandwrite' would have to
be re-built?

Not necessary. mtd-utils, for example, maintain their own copy of the
mtd-abi.h file, which I personally think is a good idea.

But if your apps depend on the kernel headers, then yes, you will need
to amend it or copy the old header into your project.

IOW, the patch breaks API by renaming, but not ABI, I think. I do not
see this as a major problem - just a small inconvenience.

It will, because size of the structure is part of the ioctl number,
even. See the corresponding ioctl macro definition.

Sure, this is the whole point: go ahead and design the new ioctl, and
then deprecate the old one. Just invest men/hours into that and we are
all right :-)
