I forgot to add that the same 80% loss happens with mq-deadline plus
throttling, sorry.  In addition, mq-deadline suffers from much more
than a 18% loss of throughput, w.r.t. bfq, exactly in the same figure
you cited, if there are random writes too.

Some more detail on this.  The fact that bfq reaches a lower
throughput than none in this test is actually still puzzling me,
because the process rate of I/O with bfq is one order of magnitude
higher than the IOPS of this device.  So, I still don't understand
why, with bfq, the queue of the device does not get as full as with
none, and thus why the throughput with bfq is not the same as with
none.

To further test this issue, I replaced sync I/O with async I/O (with a
very high depth).  And, nonsensically (for me), throughput dropped
with both bfq and none!  I already meant to to report this issue,
after investigating it more.  Anyway, this is a different story w.r.t.
this thread.

Thanks,
Paolo
