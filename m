Daniel,

I retest with suspend&resume on my board, each time that board would
reset the timing in the
begining of pxa3xx_cmdfunc as expected. So this should be ok as it is
the same behavior
with original code.

However, it certainly has some potential risk in the suspend&resume process.
That is in pxa3xx_nand_suspend and pxa3xx_nand_resume, it should call
mtd->suspend and mtd->resume
respectively.

This implement has already existed in our code release for years, but
have get into the mainline yet.
So I tend to merged into the third patch, and you could have test
again whether could fix your issue.

Thanks,
Lei
