Okay, I own it.  And I have a good grasp of how most of the driver
operates.  However, it is unreasonable to request that someone who
conducts Mainlining activities who is not the author to understand
every single line.

It's now commonplace for an 'author' and 'submitter' to be different
people.  The only difference is that normally the author is still
around to provide support.  Or at least the submitter has access to a
team who have in-depth knowledge of the hardware/driver.

I have submitted drivers and fixes all over the kernel tree and have a
fairly good knowledge of each of the subsystems, but to ask that I
become an expert in all of them -- especially subsystems as complex as
MTD is idealistic and unrealistic at best.

> Or else, hire another expert who is willing to own your drivers.

Silicon chip vendors do not have limitless resources to hire or train
experts to conduct all their upstreaming activities?  These guys are
almost always focused on customer projects/requests and have little
time for upstreaming.  It's people like us to advocate and encourage
pushing code into Mainline, as the cost of upstreaming is usually
dwarfed by the cost of migrating a huge delta to a more recent code
base.  This activity however, has not a good example of that.

At the moment, what you're saying is; if your NOR Contreoller is not
exactly the same as all the others and doesn't fit inside our
mega-driver, it's not welcome.

See my point above about the lack of limitless funds.

Stop twisting things.  You (unnecessarily) explained to me what
va_args was.  I was saying that I know what it is and how to declare
functions with variable arguments.  Not that I knew what the MACRO was
doing.

Refer to my points above.
