Hi Michael,

> Any suggestion, help or hint will be very much appreciated.
Actually I have one.
Before we change the timeout, I'd like to see the sequence of register accesses.

As I owe a patch to Brian on this topic, I'd like to have you as a tester. In
return, I'll analyse the output of debug traces it generates for you.

The patch is at the bottom of this mail, and a "git am" on the mail should apply
it to your kernel. It leaves up to you to add the "#define VERBOSE_DEBUG 1" in
pxa3xx-nand.c, recompile, and take the traces.

Once I have the traces, I will be able to compare with my traces on pxa3xx
platforms and spot if there is a difference. Then we'll be able to see if
increasing the timeout is the only option.

Cheers.

Subject: [PATCH v2] mtd: nand: pxa3xx_nand: add register access debug

Add verbose debug for register accesses. This enables easier debugging
by following where and how hardware is stimulated, and how it answers.
