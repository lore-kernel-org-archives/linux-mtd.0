In the fifth revision some more changes, which have been made in the
U-Boot driver, have been applied to this driver too. The driver now
uses dedicated vf610_nfc_read_page/vf610_nfc_write_page functions
which feel more appropriate for the device. This changes enable raw
page writes, which in turn enables to use the the mtd_nandbiterrs.ko
test.

Beside that, the changes from the reviews have been implemented.

If one is interested in the individual changes, the U-Boot patchset,
which has been applied/adopted and squashed into this driver, is
available in the U-Boot mailing list archive:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.boot-loaders.u-boot/220416

The patchset is based on the patchset by Bill Pringlemeir, see:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/295419

The driver passes the MTD tests, the logs are attched inline, below
the change log.

Performance key points on Colibri VF61:
mtd_speedtest: testing eraseblock write speed
mtd_speedtest: eraseblock write speed is 5417 KiB/s
mtd_speedtest: testing eraseblock read speed
mtd_speedtest: eraseblock read speed is 13012 KiB/s
mtd_speedtest: testing page write speed

Changes since v4:
- Rebased ontop of l2-mtd/master (v4.1-rc4 based)
- Eliminate unnecessary page read (NAND_CMD_SEQIN) since the driver does
  not support sub-page writes anyway (improves write performance)
- Support ONFI by enabling READID command with offset and parameter page
  reads (CMD_PARAM)
- Change to dedicated read_page/write_page function, enables raw writes
- Use __LITTLE_ENDIAN to distingush between LE/BE relevant statements
- Eliminated vf610_nfc_probe_dt in favor of common DT init code
- Use wait_for_completion_timeout
- Some style fixes (spaces, etc.)

Changes since v3:
- Make the driver selectable when COMPILE_TEST is set
- Fix compile error due to superfluous ECC_STATUS configuration in initial
  patch (without ECC correction ECC_STATUS does not need to be configured)
- Remove custom BBT pattern and switch to in-band BBT in the initial patch
- Include two bug fixes, for details see the corresponding U-Boot patches:
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.boot-loaders.u-boot/215802

Changes since v2:
- Updated binding documentation

Changes since v1:
- Nest nfc_config struct within the main nfc struct
- Use assigned clock binding to specify NFC clock
- Rebased ontop of MSCM IR patchset (driver parts have been merged)
- Split out arch Kconfig in a separate config
- Fix module license
- Updated MAINTAINERS

Changes since RFC (Bill Pringlemeir):
- Renamed driver from fsl_nfc to vf610_nfc
- Use readl/writel for all register in accessor functions
- Optimized field accessor functions
- Implemented PM (suspend/resume) functions
- Implemented basic support for ECC strength/ECC step size from dt
- Improved performance of count_written_bits by using hweight32
- Support ECC with 60-bytes to correct up to 32 bit errors
- Changed to in-band BBT (NAND_BBT_NO_OOB) which also allows ECC modes
  which uses up to 60 bytes on 64 byte OOB
- Removed custom (downstream) BBT pattern since BBT table won't be
  compatible anyway (due to the change above)
