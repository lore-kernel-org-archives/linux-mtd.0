=46rom [3]: none with throttling loses 80% of the throughput when used
to control I/O. On any drive. And this is really only one example among =
a ton.

In addition, the test you mention, designed by me, was meant exactly
to find and show the worst breaking point of BFQ.  If your main
workload of interest is really made only of tens of parallel thread
doing only sync random I/O, and you care only about throughput,
without any concern for your system becoming so unresponsive to be
unusable during the test, then, yes, mq-deadline is a better option
for you.

So, are you really sure the balance is in favor of mq-deadline?

Thanks,
Paolo
