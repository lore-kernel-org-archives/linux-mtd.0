The way it adds up now for ext4 is:

128 bytes for base inode
+ 32 bytes for i_extra fields
+ 4 bytes for in-inode xattrs header
+ 20 bytes for encryption xattr header + name
+ 28 bytes for encryption xattr value
----------------------------------
= 212 bytes total.

By adding the 16-byte 'key_hash' field it grows to 228 bytes total.  So it still
fits in a 256-byte inode, though it's getting closer to the limit.  We could
save 8 bytes by instead using the design where master_key_descriptor is extended
to 16 bytes and redefined as a cryptographically secure hash.  But as noted,
that has some significant disadvantages.

Also note that we don't really have to worry about leaving space for a SELinux
xattr anymore because with 256-byte inodes + encryption the SELinux xattr is
already being written to an external block, given that it requires about 52-62
bytes (at least when using Android's SELinux policy; different SELinux policies
may use different values), and 212 + 52 > 256.  So if someone wants both xattrs
in-inode they need to use 512-byte inodes already.
