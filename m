+AD4 You can repeat these tests using one of my first scripts in the S

+AD4 I stopped sharing also my kernel-build results years ago, because I
+AD4 went on obtaining the same, identical good results for years, and I'm
+AD4 aware that I tend to show and say too much stuff.

On my test setup building the kernel is slightly slower when using the BFQ
scheduler compared to using scheduler +ACI-none+ACI (kernel 4.18.12, NVMe SSD,
single CPU with 6 cores, hyperthreading disabled). I am aware that the
proposal at the start of this thread was to make BFQ the default for devices
with a single hardware queue and not for devices like NVMe SSDs that support
multiple hardware queues.

What I think is missing is measurement results for BFQ on a system with
multiple CPU sockets and against a fast storage medium. Eliminating
the host lock from the SCSI core yielded a significant performance
improvement for such storage devices. Since the BFQ scheduler locks and
unlocks bfqd-+AD4-lock for every dispatch operation it is very likely that BFQ
will slow down I/O for fast storage devices, even if their driver only
creates a single hardware queue.
