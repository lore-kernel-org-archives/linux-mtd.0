Hi Lothar:

    Thanks a lot for your carefully review.

The nand_ids{} contains poor information for me.
Such as :
[1]The nand_ids does not have the enough information for the page 
size,oob size for some new NANDs.
    And you can not get the information from parsing the NAND ids, such 
as some Micron NANDs.

[2]I need the timing information of the NAND. The nand_ids DOES not have 
it. I have to
    read the datasheet of the NAND, and add it to my database.

[3]I need the information about the error Management for BCH.
    The BCH module needs to know the ECC information of the NAND, the 
nand_ids{} does not have it.
Different NANDs may have different ECC requires such as "Minimum 
required ECC".

We have saled a lot products based the imx23 or imx28.
All the products support the nand boot mode by flashing the kernel to 
the kernel partitions of the nands.
In order to compliant to the old product, the layout of the nand is 
constraint to the current situation:
[1] first a boot partition for the kernel.
[2] the rest is for other uses, such as rootfs.

So I have to use the rom_helpers to split the kernel partition before 
the real MTD partition initializations.

Ok. Frankly speaking, the file is auto created by some tools from the
