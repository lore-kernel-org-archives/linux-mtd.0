Yes.

It is not impossible, and XFS has had exactly the same issues - but
remember that XFS has to work with the block layer with drivers which
have no idea that the memory they're writing/reading may be also mapped
into vmalloc space.  The two functions at the bottom of cachetlb.txt were
invented to allow XFS to do this.

It's probably going to be better to have a MTD block API for DMA which
provides a scatterlist to the MTD block driver, and which knows whether
the memory is from vmalloc.  When it is, it takes care of the flushing
via those two functions I referred to in cachetlb.txt.

This keeps the magic out of the individual MTD block drivers, and stops
them replicating the same mistakes time and time again - and also means
that you won't have to teach everyone about this.

It doesn't make sense for the DMA API to deal with vmalloc - MTD is
one of the very few (the only?) subsystems which does this.
