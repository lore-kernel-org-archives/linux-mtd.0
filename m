Agreed, and actually I tried to sync ext4 as much as possible for further work
like 2.) and 3.) below. ;)

IMO, it'd better to do 3.) followed by 2.), since 2.) already needs to change
fs/crypto which does not give much backporting effort.

I found one issue in my patch and modified it in f2fs tree [1]. Given next merge
window probable starting next week, let me upstream this modified one first
through f2fs. Then, you can see it in 4.12-rc1 two weeks later, so fscrypt
patches can be easily integrated after then. If you have any concern, I'm also
okay to push this patch through fscrypt. Let me know.
