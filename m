Hi,

I think Ivan is right, the only issue is how you flash your images. This
problem is not JFFS2-specific, you'd have it with UBIFS as well.

For UBIFS users, I described this issue here:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html#L_flasher_algo

You might find it useful, because this basically applies to JFFS2 as
well, but for JFFS2 the problem can be solved by simply making sure your
images are not padded to the eraseblock size and that your flasher does
not do the padding.

For "I cannot change my industrial flasher" case we nowadays have a
solution in the UBIFS level:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubifs.html#L_free_space_fixup

Similar thing could be implemented for JFFS2, I guess, but not sure.

HTH
