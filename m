I Pulled this branch into nand/next and had to resolve a few conflicts
(as you may have noticed, a few other reworks in the NAND and MTD layer
have been merged in the meantime).

It compiles, but I'm not sure it works correctly (I pushed the result
to nand/next-with-gpmc-rework [1]). Could you test it before I push this
to nand/next?

Thanks,

Boris
