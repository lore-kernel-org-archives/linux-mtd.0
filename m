This back to what Mike ask me... The reason why we need the
built_in_table, is for we need tell what the special nand chip want
which cannot be gotten from bootloader setting. For the nand chip may
need higher ecc strength, like 8bit per 512 bytes. This require
kernel use different approach to deal with.

It is better that kernel could be standalone, so that we would be
troubled by the mistake of bootloader. For UBOOT or blob, it is not a
must thing, we could load kernel directly from OBM. (If you want to do
that, like kernel as bootloader...)

Thanks,
Lei
