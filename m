Well, it's not entirely true. We could have a nand_scan_ident_cleanup()
function, but that means patching all the drivers anyway to make them
call this function when something fails between nand_scan_ident() and
nand_scan_tail().

As already discussed privately, I don't think these hooks belongs in
nand_ecc_ctrl. It's more something that is controller-related, so how
about adding them to the nand_hw_ctrl struct?

nand_release() is not exactly the opposite of nand_scan() because it
also takes care of the mtd dev unregistration. I think what you're
looking for is nand_cleanup().

Can we try to do this progressively instead of sending a new
version of a 50+ patch series? How about we first try to fix all
drivers that do not call nand_cleanup() when something fails after
nand_scan_tail()?

Once we have that fixed, I'd be happy to review the other patches ;-).

Anyway, thanks for working on that. The 'no dynamic allocation in
nand_scan_ident()' has been a painful limitation, and I'm glad to see
it disappear.

Regards,

Boris
