Hi Linus,

Based on FMC2 datasheet,
The FMC2 controller includes 2 memory controllers:
  - the NOR/PSRAM memory controller
  - the NAND memory controller

The NOR/PSRAM controller mapping is starting at 0.
The NAND controller mapping is starting at 0x80.

We have only planned to develop a driver for the NAND memory controller.
There is currently no customer request to develop the NOR/PSRAM memory 
controller.

The bit FMC2_BCR1_FMC2EN is not used to switch from an IP version to 
another. After reset, the FMC2 controller is disabled. Once all the used 
memory controllers are configured, the FMC2 controller must be enabled 
by setting the FMC2EN bit in the FMC2_BCR1 register. If this bit is not 
set, the controller stays in disabled state.

Regards,
Christophe Kerello.
