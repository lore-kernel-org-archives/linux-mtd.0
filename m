To be clear: I'm simply asking what do you mean by "agreed method". I
never agreed to syscfg registers/offsets. So who did? Are you agreeing
with yourself?

Seriously? That's all you can come up with? Sheesh. And you wonder why I
called you out on not understanding the code that you're sending me.

OK. So you're dealing with the "how" but not the "why." That is not a
reasonable way to develop good code.

I understand what you're doing with syscfg and these register offsets.
But if you follow the code as to what they're actually producing, you
see that it yields the 'booted_from_spi' boolean. That's a pretty simple
concept.

Now, unless you were able to provide an additional enlightening
viewpoint, then the following paragraph likely all holds true:

And so we have also reached the boundaries of my willingness to review
your code. There's a significant technical point here that drove you to
define several new DT compatible strings. I propose (and am now more
convinced) that this is not actually necessary. But apparently you are
not equipped to have a discussion about this.

I'm tempted to:

  git rm drivers/mtd/devices/st_spi_fsm.c

(Along with the appropriate Kconfig and Makefile entries, of course.)
