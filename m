I understand if we need to ease things in as well, I don't intend this
change for the current merge window or anything, since v4.19
will notably have this patch:

commit d5038a13eca72fb216c07eb717169092e92284f1
Author: Johannes Thumshirn <jthumshirn@suse.de>

    scsi: core: switch to scsi-mq by default

    It has been more than one year since we tried to change the default from
    legacy to multi queue in SCSI with commit c279bd9e406 ("scsi: default to
    scsi-mq"). But due to issues with suspend/resume and performance problems
    it had been reverted again with commit cbe7dfa26eee ("Revert "scsi: default
    to scsi-mq"").

    In the meantime there have been a substantial amount of performance
    improvements and suspend/resume got fixed as well, thus we can re-enable
    scsi-mq without a significant performance penalty.

I guess that patch can be a bit scary by itself. But IIUC it all went
fine this time!

But hey, if that works, that means $SUBJECT patch will enable BFQ on all
libata devices and any SCSI that is single queue as well, not just
"obscure" stuff like MMC/SD and UBI, and that is
indeed a massive crowd of legacy devices. But we're talking
v4.21 here.

Johannes, you might be interested in $SUBJECT patch.
It'd be nice to hear what SUSE people have to add, since they
are pretty proactive in this area.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
