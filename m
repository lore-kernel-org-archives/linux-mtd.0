sure,  thanks for the comments. :)

Currently, I am introducing the atmel pragrammable multibit ECC(PMECC) 
hardware code to nand flash. I meet following situation that I need 
change the write_page()'s return value to 'int':

when writing one page into a nand flash with PMECC enabled, the hardware 
engine will compute the BCH ecc code for this page. so we need read a 
the status register to theck whether the ecc code is generated.
But we cannot assume the status register always can be ready, (for 
instance, incorrect hardware configuration or hardware issue), in such 
case I need write_page() to return a error code.

So this is the reason that I push this patch to change the return value 
to int.

In original version seems the 'return' is useless. I change this only 
because the write_page() function's return type is changed.

No. This is not the reason for this patch as I said above.

Maybe in this case I need print the error code as well.
