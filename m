NO. This just looks fine!
nvmem-cells is the nvmem provider node without which you would not have 
any provider instance.
All this looks as expected!
Am not sure what is the problem here!

Let me repeat what I have said in my previous emails:

Having a subnode still sounds very fragile to me,
and this could be much specific case of MTD provider. We might have
instances where this could be sub-sub node of the the original provider
for other providers. Also I do not want to bring in Provider specifics 
layout into nvmem bindings.

I can not make myself any clearer than this, Its going to be a NAK from 
my side for the above reasons!

Also, patch I shared should give enough flexibility to various range of 
providers which have different child node layouts without touching the 
nvmem bindings. If it works please use it.


thanks,
