Yeah I thought it was weird too. I was thinking that maybe the pin muxes 
were getting changed and the rb net or the interrupt net was getting 
changed to a different function.

I did decompile to 2 dtb's and I couldn't find many differences. They 
were mostly around some pull ups and drive strength for some of the NAND 
and i2c pins. I tried adding those changes and it still didn't work so I 
went back to the minimal set of changes to reproduce the bug.

That patch seems to be in my 4.12-rc1 kernel, I have a definition for 
the TC58NVG2S0H.

Is there anything I can do on this end to help debug ?
