Well, I would love it if there are only 'minor comments'.  I don't think
people will like the 'nfc' name.  I wanted a better name.  Also, the
'linux-mtd' list bounced my post because I used some 'Ref:' to refer to
another message.  It also bounce on the ARM list, but some kind
moderator put it through.

 etc.

Besides the Vybrid, the controller can support several other SOCs (some
ARM, some note), Such as the MPC5125 (PowerPC), MCF54418 (ColdFire) and
the Kinetis K70 (ARM Cortex-M).

I also have some tickets open on the Hardware ECC with the Vybrid.

 https://community.freescale.com/message/368216 - ECC value
 https://community.freescale.com/message/384556 - clocking

[There are also non-public freescale PR tickets]

Especially, the ECC layout is important.  I think that an HW ECC layout
with sub-page support is best.  The Linux-MTD community will want this
to be right.  

The email "reference" was a previous email I sent some time ago to the
MTD mailing list.  I wondered if anyone was interested and I knew that
people would not like the name 'fsl_nfc'.  But I don't know what to call
it; it is a bike shed issue to me (specifics of what to call it), but I
see how people will want to avoid a generic ambigious name like
'fsl_nfc'.

I was waiting to see about the clocking with HW-ECC; it seems above
33MHz, the HW-ECC module doesn't seem to work (at least for me).

Fwiw,
Bill Pringlemeir.
