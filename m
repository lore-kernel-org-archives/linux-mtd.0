Well, that's ugly. Really, the SD controller should be modeled as a 
clock provider. But then you would have to always have a driver 
instantiated for it. Maybe you need that anyway if accessing this 
register is dependent on some other clock or reset to the module being 
enabled (which you may not hit if you only access the reg during boot)?

But if you really want to do it this way, I guess that is fine.

Yes.
