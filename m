Got that, that was why I added the various additional traces in that
horrid patch in the mail you are responding to :-)

Ahh, *that* NAND DMA configuration. Of course, how silly of me...

This is a setup based on the at91-linea.dtsi "CPU" board. That dtsi should
have the relevant NAND/DMA info. Also, at91-nattis-2-natte-2.dts describes
the older HW (with a 1024x768 panel) that is also affected, if you want a
full device tree to look at.

Looks like I didn't make a selection, quoting from at91-linea.dtsi:

&ebi {
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_ebi_nand_addr>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	status = "okay";
};

&nand_controller {
	status = "okay";

	nand: nand@3 {
		reg = <0x3 0x0 0x2>;
		atmel,rb = <0>;
		nand-bus-width = <8>;
		nand-ecc-mode = "hw";
		nand-ecc-strength = <4>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;
		nand-on-flash-bbt;
		label = "atmel_nand";
	};
};

The reason is probably because the sama5d3xek device-trees didn't at the
time of "fork". Does anybody have any suggestion for some extra properties
to try in the above nodes?

Further, I forgot that I had actually upstreamed linea support for
at91bootstrap, so relevant NAND timings etc can be found in lpddr1_init()
in

	at91bootstrap/contrib/board/axentia/sama5d3_linea/sama5d3_linea.c

Cheers,
Peter
