OK, so we can agree that using this hardware acceleration for any kind
of transfer indiscriminately is not a very good idea.

Now since the description is clearer it's obvious that ti-qspi cannot
work fully mmapped as fsl-qspi does because the setup has to be done
over normal spi access and using non-m25p80 devices on the same bus is
a requirement.

The place where it is known if a transfer can use the mmap access is m25p80.c

So my suggestion is

 - add a new method for spi master that gets the read opcode, dummy
length, address, address length, buffer, buffer length and performs
read from the flash memory in a hardware-specific way

- add a check in m25p80.c that the master supports this feature and if
so use it (eg check that the method is non-null)

Presumably if some new SPI controllers with similar feature are
supported in the future they can use the same inteface because you
pass on everything the m25p80 read knows.

Thanks
