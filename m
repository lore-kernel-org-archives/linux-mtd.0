ECC requirements are almost always something that has to be matched to
the bootloader (since the bootloader typicaly reads the NAND to boot),
so it is sensible to put that in the DT

The timings are a property of the chip, and if they can be detected
they should be. IMHO, the main purpose of a DT property would be to
lower the speed if, for some reason, the board cannot support the
device's full speed.

IIRC for ONFI a device must always work in the mode 0 timings, without
requiring a command?
