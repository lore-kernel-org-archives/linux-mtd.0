It's already a bitfield in the end: it's the mask for the interrupt status
register. It might have been better if it were called rb_edge_mask.

I'm reluctant about this, but I will do it. For me, we are exchanging
a single probe-time copy to indirections in each interrupt handler for some
unspecified future user. Let's hope the tradeoff is worth it.

It's already so verbose, it will make everything longer. Once the member name
contains the 'mask' part, all the information will be there.

The whole file could be rewritten in this form, but I see this as a
zero-value proposition. I believe it is best to keep with local
consistency. In fact, I will rather remove RB_EDGE1 & RB_EDGE2, as
those are not mentioned in the datasheets.


Best regards,
