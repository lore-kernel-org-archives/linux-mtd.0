Woops. This indeed doesn't work.
Note that the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() is also gone from m25p80.c

So m25p80.c needs to contain the IDs, while spi-nor.c also needs the IDs
because it's a framework/library.

A quick solution would be to move the ID table to a header file, and include
that by both, and re-add the lost MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() to m25p80.c.
That duplicates the data, though.

Hmm, for the built-in case, we can avoid the duplication by letting m25p80.c
refer to the table in spi-nor.c if !MODULE.
Does anyone see a better solution?

Fsl-qspi is not a generic SPI driver, but a dedicated SPI NOR driver.
It's programmed using high-level SPI NOR commands, instead of low-level
SPI commands.
