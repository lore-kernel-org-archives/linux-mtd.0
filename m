Hm, since nand_scan_ident access the devices we actually want the
controller initialized before we access it the first time. In most
cases, the boot loader/boot ROM probably initialized the controller in a
way that identifying the chip should work non the less. However, the
safe way would be to initialize it before calling nand_scan_ident.

However, I see your point regarding bus width: With the change to
nand_dt_init, we have that information after nand_scan_ident. There is
actually more: Also the HW ECC settings are not yet parsed at that
point, hence the ECC status and offset will not be initialized right. 

We could call the whole initialization twice. This would configure 8-Bit
mode for the 16-Bit devices, but during initialization this is anyway
the required default (ONFI). Or we split it up and call it something
like vf610_nfc_preinit_controller and vf610_nfc_init_controller.

What do you think?
