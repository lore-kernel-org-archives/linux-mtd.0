I think this change is more subtle than it looks at first glance. There
are a few points:

(1) This kind of flash format is naturally fairly imprecise and
unfocused; the parser is scanning every block on the device, so its
scans have to have pretty good heuristics to ensure that it doesn't
treat some other block of data as containing AFS metadata. This usually
works out OK when using magic strings and checksums, but it's still not
100% foolproof.

(2) You're dropping some of the safeguards -- particularly the checksum
-- from the first pass that calculates the number of partitions. This
seems OK for now, since you still do the same checks later, and if they
fail, you just skip the block. But it means that if the block isn't
exactly perfect (whether it's due to malice, coincidence, or
corruption), then we have a problem in the second pass through the
device.

(3) The "problem" from (2) is currently only a slightly
larger-than-necessary memory allocation -- we allocate for too many
partitions -- which is benign. But in later patches, you change the
second loop's behavior so that checksum errors become fatal. That means
that any block that happens to have the magic number in the right (or
wrong, depending on your POV) place will cause the entire parsing
process to fail. That's probably a bug, not a feature.

So, is it really worth saving mtd_read()'ing 16 bytes of flash really
worth this extra fragility? I think you should still read the whole
footer and check its checksum before declaring it a 'v1' footer. And
don't make a checksum failure completely fatal; just make it skip the
block.

Regards,
Brian
