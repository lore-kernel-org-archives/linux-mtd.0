This sounds like the problem Rafał wanted to solve in his patch "mtd:
add support for typed parsers splitting partitions"

This would also solve my problem and would make the bcm47xx part parser
a lot simpler and more secure for targets using device tree.
I still think we should add a alternative for the people that do not
want to rewrite their partition parser. Specifying the list of available
partition parser in the flash driver is a bad idea because it is the
wrong place.

I am in favor of both concepts, because there is already one driver
reading the partition parser list from device tree and it is implemented
pretty easy. Jonas Approach sounds nice because it really solves two
more problems.
Jonas approach would work on bcm47xx and bcm53xx targets, because there
the header is located after the boot loader and does not contain all
partitions. This could also be used to divide the partition containing
the kernel and the read only root fs in OpenWrt. Are there any more
users which could use this extended approach?
