Sure, but did anyone (Arnd?) have thoughts on a better way to do this:

+#ifdef CONFIG_64BIT
+               buf64[i++] = readq_relaxed(io_base);
+#else
+               buf64[i++] = *(const volatile u64 __force *)io_base;
+#endif

IMHO, readq should exist on any platform that can issue a 64 bit bus
transaction, and I expect many ARM's qualify.

Likely, what is happening is that the bus interface is holding off
returning the read data until it complets the bus cycles, then the
response travels to the CPU which turns around another.

This creates a dead time where the bus isn't do anything.

The larger bus transfer the CPU can do the less percentage of time the
turnaround takes as overhead.

If the cpu could pipeline two reads then it could be highest-possible,
but I guess the memory ordering for the mapping prevents that??

Regarding DMA, who knows if the interface can handle a burst
transfer..
