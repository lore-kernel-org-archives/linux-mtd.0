I agree - blink_delay can be altered by a LED class driver in case
it implements blink_set op, which would have global impact on all
LED class drivers registered on this trigger.

Ezequiel, please make the blink_delay variable local to
ledtrig_mtd_activity. We well need also to provide a fix for
ledtrig-ide-disk.c.

We'll need to create a patch that removes all redundant extern modifiers
from leds.h, but please keep it in this one for consistency.
