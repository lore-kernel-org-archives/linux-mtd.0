Which will happen most of the time (unless the image file size is near
a multiple of the eraseblock size), if you create an jffs2 image with
mkfs.jffs2 and the '-p' option.

Unfortunately the data written by U-Boot must be page aligned and
mkfs.jffs2 cannot generate images that fulfill that constraint (unless
you know the exact image file size beforehand and specify the
rounded-up file size with the '-p' option).

I know, that it cannot simply erase such blocks.

I have no idea how and where it should be fixed.
- at driver level, creating an all-FF ECC for all-FF data?
- in the bootloader and mtd-utils preventing stretches of all-FF data
  to be written?
- in mkfs.jffs2, enabling it to generate images that are padded to
  page size instead of eraseblock size?
