UBI is supported by U-Boot as well and U-Boot supports storing its
environment inside an UBI volume, loading things from volumes or even
mounting UBIFS, so information about which partition to attach might
already be useful outside of Linux as well.
Apart from that, DT already stores a whole lot of Linux-specific
properties, such as linux,keycodes or for gpio-keys-polled or
linux,default-trigger for LEDs. Not having that information in the
devicetree would definitely make things worse imho.

True, but devices which do not have UBI will throw some errors to the
log about not being able to attach the device.

Definitely not something I'd hope to get into at all, however, I can
smell it coming ;)
