When I say "agreed method", I mean the way in which we obtain syscfg
registers/offsets, not the reason for using them.  How is that not
clear in the commit log, "agreed method of acquiring syscfg registers/
offsets"?

And no, you never agreed to that.  You weren't part of the
conversation.  For your own reference one of the first patches which
deals with this "newly agreed method" and supplies a succinct
explanation can be found here:

I'm dealing with answering the question that was asked.  You mentioned
that you did not "agree" to using the boot devices in this way and I
was explaining that when I said "agreed", I was talking about
something else.

> That is not a reasonable way to develop good code.

I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about.  This patch was
designed to introduce a clean way to extract important values from
syscfg to be used with functionality written by our local MTD expert.
I don't know about you, but I believe that identifying a need, setting
an aim and successfully achieving that aim is a great way to code.

Unless of course you re you insinuating that I should have been aware
of conversations which you previously had with other parties about
resilience to mode setting over reset/power-outage?

I already explained to you that I am not an MTD expert and still you
cut me no slack.  At one time I was supported by someone who can
answer all of these questions; however, as you well know, this is no
longer the case.  The company does have people that specialise in MTD,
but they are so busy with customer projects that they have no time to
support these endeavours.  So I am on my own!

Everything that I know now, I have learned from you.  So please don't
act so surprised when I struggle to answer all these new questions
you're posing.

Okay, I'm re-read the code and have a new understanding about the
boot-from-spi 'gymnastics'. 

There is a separate controller on the platform which acts as a boot
device and makes the NOR chip appear as though it is memory mapped.
This expects the NOR Controller to be in its default state [24-bit
addressing] on boot.  The issue arises if a warm-reset occurs and the
device is still in 32-bit addressing mode.  To minimise the risk, the
controller attempts to stay in 24-bit addressing mode for as long as
possible.

You mentioned power-cuts.  I do not believe this to be an issue, as
when the power is completely removed the controller will reset back
into default state.  Only warm-resets are an issue.

That would be very immature indeed.

We wouldn't be able to remove this code without significantly
weakening resilience to warm-reset mishaps, and changing the hardware
design for devices which have already been released is obviously out
of the question.
