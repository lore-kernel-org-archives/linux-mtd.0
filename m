I have never written a line of code that I didn't understand and I
think you are quite aware that this has never been my 'own code'.

With regards to the previous accumulation of 'answers like this'; I
have never been, nor have any desire to be an expert on Memory
Technology Devices.  I was asked to upstream ST's NAND and NOR drivers
with support of the local expert and author; however, for reasons not
under neither of our controls, he has now left the company.  With him
went all of the historical reasoning for all for the questions you've
asked.  This is not my domain and have found it pretty tough to keep
up with all of your demands, both on this and the NAND driver but I
have been pretty subservient and keep up with them I have.  I am not
privy to any of the author's thoughts or reasons for any decisions
taken.  I can only hope that his comments might have some meaning to a
like minded 'expert' such as yourself.  If you don't know something,
then the chances are slight that I will be able to answer your query.

I was present Passing Variable Arguments 101, so I'm aware of what
__VA_ARGS__ and "..." do at a functional level.

So it looks like you had a better idea of what Angus was trying to
achieve than I do.  Perhaps your question should have been more
specific.  I guess it's just the comment that you are unhappy with.  I
can remove it if it makes you happy.
