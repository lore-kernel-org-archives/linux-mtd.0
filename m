Currently yes, nor->addr_width, nor->read_opcode, nor->read_dummy, and
nor->program_opcode are set once for all in spi_nor_scan().

However, nor->read() is likely to be called soon from spi_nor_scan()
with values of nor->addr_width, nor->read_opcode and nor->read_dummy
different from those selected when exiting spi_nor_scan().

So nor->read() / mt8173_nor_read should check nor->addr_width,
nor->read_opcode and nor->read_dummy at each call.

More precisely, I plan to use nor->read() from spi_nor_scan() to read
SFDP (Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters) data.

Whatever op code, numbers of address bytes and dummy cycles used for
(Fast) Read commands, the Read SFDP command uses fixed settings
standardized for all manufacturers and all memory parts:
- op code: 5Ah
- number of bytes for the address: 3 (even for memory > 128Mbits)
- number of dummy clock cycles: 8 clocks

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/742380/

Please have a look at the spi_nor_read_sfdp().

spi_nor_read_sfdp() is likely to be called from and only from
spi_nor_scan().

Best regards,

Cyrille
