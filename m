Yes, that's why I think we should "upgrade" the nvmem binding as a whole
and not just limit this to the MTD case.

If there are cells defined yes, but nvmem also allow referencing the
provider as a whole, so cells are optional. But yes it could be
removed, in the case of MTD it is only used to filter the relevant
devices to avoid having too many "useless" nvmem device registered.
