You can't mark a nonempty directory as encrypted.  First, you can't have an
unencrypted file *name* in an encrypted directory, because then all the
operations on that filename won't work, because the filesystem will think it is
encrypted.  Second, you cannot have an unencrypted file in an encrypted
directory because that violates the constraint that all files in an encrypted
directory are encrypted -- and by design that is verified on ->lookup().

So to get it to actually work in ext4 we'd need to add extra special-case logic
around the lost+found directory -- probably allowing both the directory entry
and directory itself to be unencrypted, despite existing in an encrypted
directory.  And I think that solution would be more complicated than the
test_dummy_encryption mount option we have now.

It may be worth reconsidering if people start asking for the ability to encrypt
the root directory for other reasons, though.  (Although, that use case is
largely redundant with dm-crypt.)
