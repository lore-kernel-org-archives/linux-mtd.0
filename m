There is no incentive to discern solo/dual, afaict this are the same
chips, only some IP's "fused away"... From GPMI NAND perspective, they
are definitely the same.

So that leaves us with "imx7-gpmi-nand" vs. "imx7d-gpmi-nand".

All device tree compatible strings as well as Kconfig symbol,
preprocessor defines and function prefixes have been named "imx7d" or
IMX7D so far... Although they work just fine for i.MX7 Solo too... Not
sure why that exactly ended up to be that way, but I guess the reason
was that NXP started to upstream with the dual...

For the sake of continuity, I would prefer if we stick to that (as my
current patchsets do)... It is like imx6q, which also works for dual...

$ grep -r -w compatible.*imx7d  arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dts* | wc -l
68
$ grep -r -w compatible.*imx7^d  arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dts* | wc -l
0

Agreed.
