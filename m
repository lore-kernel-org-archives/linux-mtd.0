Like this?

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/473180/

I'd like to avoid that (hence the "Rejected" status).

Yes, "ofpart" is for specifying the entire partition table in the device
tree as subnodes of either the flash node or of the flash's "partitions"
subnode. It's not the most flexible, but it does work generically.

I have something working here, but I haven't had time to finish cleaning
it up and submitting it. There's an older patch that works similarly,
though it has some deficiencies:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/475988/

The main difference between that and my (yet-to-be-submitted) proposal
is that I'd like parsers to opt in by adding a proper of_match_table
with non-Linux-specific DT bindings, and then we can drop the
"linux,..." naming and make it a reasonably generic property.

Regards,
Brian
