Ha, right. Sorry, I don't really know this particular IP.

I don't believe that conclusion follows though.

The code structure isn't bad, and yes, IS_ENABLED() would be preferable,
as it removes some of the problems with #ifdef, but I still don't think
the processor architecture has much to do with the version of the IP.
The canonical way of distiguishing per-IP revisions is to key on the
compatible property. So you'd have some kind of enum, which would
currently only have an entry for VF610. i.e.:

	/* MPC5125 not yet supported */
	if (nfc->revision != NAND_VFC610)
		return;

OK I don't presume to know what the different IP versions look like. And
if you just note they are unsupported/untested, you're fine.
