Hm, we currently don't have a non ECC read function as we enable ECC
unconditionally. I guess this would need a read_oob_raw implementation,
where we disable ECC, read the page, and reenable ECC...

What I currently did, is just accept strength / 2 bits. This is not a
clean solution since it will also count the ECC bits, but it works for
now:

I think we are facing multiple issues here. One might contain general
software/hardware issues (non bit-flip related). I had this issue again
on a different module with 3.18-rc5 (without the "fix" above). The
kernel output looks like this:

Interesting is that this error happens every second PEB (every 128 page,
but erase block size is 64) and it is always the second page. On that
device, this is completely reproduceable, e.g. I can erase everything
and flash it again, the same happens. 


I dumped the block in question:

Page 00240800 dump:
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  f7 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff fb ff ff ff ff ff
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
....
        ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff f7
....

I also printed flip count and ecc_count the values for all those pages
are: flip 3, ecc_count 2

Now the interesting part: When I erase the block, and dump that page
again, it is completely empty! No flips, no ecc_count anymore! UBI
attach writes something into the first page, hence it looks like this
write into the first page influences the values of the second page... I
verified this behavior this using U-Boot and the Linux kernel.

I digged a bit deeper, and wrote just zeros into the first page. In the
second page some bits are flipped. However, writing into the second page
does not influence the third page. But a bit in the first page is
flipped. And the third page influences the forth page. It looks like the
pages behave in pairs.... Any idea what kind of issue we are facing
here?
