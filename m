How about you read the thread you're responding to? This is a
different driver, and it is not broken.

If you look at the thread for the patch which fixes the actual
breakage (in pxa3xx), you will see a plain and clear explanation of
the situation.

David has been sufficiently notified, and he is not acting. I have
even pinged him on our IRC channel, with no response, although I'm not
surprised.

(BTW, I assume the "committed by David" is simply because of
git-rebase. It doesn't necessarily reflect his acknowledgment of the
patch. I can only assume that it was an oversight on his part.)

My hands are tied, as the only thing I could do would be to submit a
pull request around David's back. I am just as frustrated as you, but
for different reasons. The (lack of) response from the head MTD
maintainer is unacceptable, IMO, and it is a recurring problem that we
are trying to solve by my involvement as a submaintainer. But
merge-window problems are not quite under my authority...

Anyway, I don't care if the patch goes in via another tree, as long as
this debacle (notably, for the pxa3xx_nand driver, not the atmel_nand
driver) is resolved.
