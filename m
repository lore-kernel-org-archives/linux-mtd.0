Hi Bean,

the set_quad_mode() function should not been removed from spi-nor.c as it is
needed for both Macronix and Spansion memories.
Indeed, what macronix_quad_enable() and spansion_quad_enable() do is to change
a dedicated bit in some status/configuration register to enable Quad SPI
operations. More precisely, this disables some features such as the Write
Protection (Spansion & Macronix) or the Reset (Macronix) / Hold (Spansion) so
the associated pins can be reassigned to IO2 and IO3 data lines... and that's
all!
What I mean is that once set_quad_mode() has been called, Macronix and Spansion
memories still reply to commands such as Read Status Register in protocol
SPI 1-1-1. Of course, they now also support Fast Read 1-1-4 (0x6b) or 1-4-4
(0xeb).
For Macronix memories, setting the Quad Enable bit in its Status Register is
NOT the same as entering its QPI mode. In QPI mode, ALL commands are expected
to use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol: this mode is not used by spi-nor.c

Then going back to the Micron case, micron_quad_enable() makes the memory
enter its Quad mode where ALL commands must use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol. So
it is definitely not the same thing as what either macronix_quad_enable() or
spansion_quad_enable() do.

Also the current code of micron_quad_enable() is broken:

[...]
Here, the memory still expects the SPI 1-1-1 to be used by write_reg() or
read_reg().

	/* set EVCR, enable quad I/O */
	nor->cmd_buf[0] = val & ~EVCR_QUAD_EN_MICRON;
	ret = nor->write_reg(nor, SPINOR_OP_WD_EVCR, nor->cmd_buf, 1);
	if (ret < 0) {
		dev_err(nor->dev, "error while writing EVCR register\n");
		return ret;
	}

However, once the Quad Enable bit has been cleared into the Enhanced Volatile
Configuration Register, all commands must use the SPI 4-4-4 protocol.
Especially, the later call of spi_nor_wait_till_ready(), which calls read_reg()
to read the Status Register, will fail because the QSPI controller has to mean
to know about the protocol switch hence keeps on sending the Read Status
Register command with the wrong SPI 1-1-1 protocol.
This is the issue I faced when using a Micron memory with the Atmel QSPI
controller embedded in a sama5d2 SoC. Also for the same reason, users of the
m25p80 driver won't be able to use Micron memories for QSPI operations too.

	ret = spi_nor_wait_till_ready(nor);
	if (ret)
		return ret;
[...]

So in its current state, micron_quad_enable() prevents us from using Micron
memories for Quad SPI operations. Some code is missing to make it work.



As I said in the patch description, using the SPI 4-4-4 protocol is not
relevant for MTD usage. It would be worth for XIP operations but this is not the
purpose of the spi-nor driver.
Also, the series of patches still support the Micron Quad SPI mode: the spi-nor
driver no longer enables this mode itself but it still can adapt itself whether
the Quad SPI mode had already been enabled by a previous bootloader or at
reset. This is the purpose of the patch focusing on Read JEDEC ID commands:
it is used to probe the current state of the memory and use the SPI 4-4-4 if
needed.

Best regards,

Cyrille
