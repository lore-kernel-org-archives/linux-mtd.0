I'm not sure this is a very strong reason. It seems fairly reasonable in
general to reset a HW block before using it.

I recall this reason being mentioned before. I believe this only happens
because the brcmnand driver doesn't yet handle configuring the timing
registers, so iProc is implicitly relying on the bootloader to configure
the NAND timings. Perhaps it's time that we fix that. I'd rather not add
extra DT properties unless we actually need to [1]. And having proper
timing configuration in the Linux driver will help improve speeds for
all users (whose timings may not be configured in the bootloader).

I actually had some preliminary work to do some timing configuration
according to the new timing information from nand_base.c/nand_timing.c.
Unfortunately, I didn't complete this, and I'm no longer working at
Broadcom, so I don't exactly have access to the HW docs for all the NAND
controller revisions, nor do I have access to as much HW for testing...

[1] If we really do need a device tree differentiation, perhaps it would
be better to just differentiate the compatible string than to have
individual boolean properties. e.g.:

	compatible = "brcm,iproc-nand-ns2", ...;
