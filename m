After checking the nand_base.c, I saw it will set the 
mtd.bitflip_threshold to mtd->ecc.strength during nand_scan_tail().
in the atmel_nand code, the ecc strength will be set correctly, that 
means bitflip_threashold should be set up correctly by default.
so I think I don't need set up the the bitflip_threshold anymore if I 
set ecc strength correctly. Am I missing any point here?
