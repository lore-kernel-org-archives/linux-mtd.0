Hi Jones & Augus:

thanks for your explanations.

Frankly speaking, my quadspi driver's code is just like Jones's code.
Yes, a big "switch".

The opcode is just like an index to trigger the proper operation.
That's why i add this hook @->read_reg(). (the hook acts as the ioctl)

If we do not use this hooks, we should add more hooks such as
@->read_id, @->read_sr, @->read_cr...

That's make the interface not graceful enough.


I read the your patch implementing the read_id:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2013-November/050221.html


it's more readable. But i think Jones's stfsm_read_reg() is workable too.


If you do not like the read_reg() hook, do you have any better idea?



thanks
Huang Shijie
