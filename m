ok. I will debug it too.


Please test the driver again when you back to office.
Pay attention to your version of /arch/arm/configs/mxs_defconfig.
Your mxs_defconfig may miss Shawn Guo's patches.

thanks.

Artem said it should not change the driver, but the upper layer(jffs2).

So I think i do not need to change the driver.

I programmed for mx6q in the recent days. I have no time to fix it. The 
mx6q can runs well now.

So I will fix the issue in the following days.

My sysfs-entries is in the GPMI-NAND directory.
Does be a mainline driver means I should not have any sysfs-entries?
If it does, i can remove it.

> * custom kernel command line parameters
The kernel command line 'gpmi_nand' is to avoid the conflict with other 
modules such as
SD.

If it's be removed, I have to use different config to resolve the issue 
which is not better either. :(

The mil is used to make the gpmi_nand_data{} simple.
Without it, the gpmi_nand_data{} will very big.

The functions which have mx23 prefix are only used in mx23.
The functions which have no prefix can used in both mx28 and mx23.

Frankly speaking, the current driver is maybe the smallest version now.

I even do not add the on-chip BBT feature now.

Feel free to mail me the patch. it's welcome.

What about gtalk?
