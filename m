ok, that makes sense.

So do I understand right that 3 bytes is your minimum size, and going
smaller than that would not be helpful? Otherwise I would assume that
storing a '5' should only take one byte instead of three.

I don't unsterstand yet why you store the length of each word separate
from the word. Most variable-length codes store that implicitly in
the data itself, e.g. in the upper three bits, so that for storing
0x5, 0x1001, 0xa0000, this could e.g. end up as 0x054010014a0000,
which is shorter than what you have, but not harder to decode.

If you can save 5% on a real-world file system, you have convinced me.

ok.
