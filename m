The latter is obviously the better approach. The problem that sparse is
complaining about is the fact that you have two nested C blocks, both of
which contain a local variable called '__v'. By changing the variable
names so that they're actually unique, we fix the real problem.

The answer is not that *all* drivers which call cpu_to_le16(readw())
must be changed, which is what you seem to have assumed. And you
*certainly* can't change them to use __raw_readw(), which has
*different* semantics (and endianness in some cases), without a clear
comment in the changelog entry saying *why* that change was OK.
