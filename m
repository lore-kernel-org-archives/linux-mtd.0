Hello, here's yet another round of cleanups for fscrypt.  Please
consider for v4.18.  These are all patches I've sent out previously.
The series is based on v4.17-rc3.

Patches 1-12 mostly remove unnecessary or redundant code from a number
of different places; nothing particularly noteworthy.  Note: to avoid a
merge conflict with f2fs/dev, I've dropped the patch
"fscrypt: remove WARN_ON_ONCE() when decryption fails".

Patch 13 switches the existing warning and error messages in fscrypt
over to use a common logging function, which is ratelimited and includes
the filesystem name (->s_id) when available as well as a consistent
prefix of "fscrypt:".

Patches 14-15 are optimizations and cleanups for key lookup and key
derivation.  They are extracted from the patch "fscrypt: refactor
finding and deriving key" I had originally sent as part of the series
"fscrypt: filesystem-level keyring and v2 policy support".  But I think
they're useful changes by themselves, so no need to wait on them.

Eric Biggers (15):
  fs, fscrypt: only define ->s_cop when FS_ENCRYPTION is enabled
  fscrypt: clean up after fscrypt_prepare_lookup() conversions
  fscrypt: remove unnecessary NULL check when allocating skcipher
  fscrypt: remove error messages for skcipher_request_alloc() failure
  fscrypt: remove stale comment from fscrypt_d_revalidate()
  fscrypt: don't clear flags on crypto transform
  fscrypt: don't special-case EOPNOTSUPP from
    fscrypt_get_encryption_info()
  fscrypt: drop max_namelen check from fname_decrypt()
  fscrypt: drop empty name check from fname_decrypt()
  fscrypt: make fscrypt_operations.max_namelen an integer
  fscrypt: remove unnecessary check for non-logon key type
  fscrypt: remove internal key size constants
  fscrypt: use a common logging function
  fscrypt: separate key lookup from key derivation
  fscrypt: only derive the needed portion of the key
