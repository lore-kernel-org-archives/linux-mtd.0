Hi Jens,
I see your point, but I doubt this is the way to go, because of the
following flaws.

As also Linus Torvalds complained [1], people feel lost among
I/O-scheduler options.  Actual differences across I/O schedulers are
basically obscure to non experts.  In this respect, Linux-kernel
'users' are way more than a few top-level distros that can afford a
strong performance team, and that, basing on the input of such a team,
might venture light-heartedly to change a critical component like an
I/O scheduler.  Plus, as Linus Walleij pointed out, some users simply
are not distros that use udev.

So, probably 99% of Linux-kernel users will just stick to the default
I/O scheduler, mq-deadline, assuming that the algorithm by which that
scheduler was chosen was not "pick the scheduler with the longest
name", but "pick the best scheduler for most cases".  The problem is
that, for single-queue devices with a speed below 400/500 KIOPS, the
default scheduler is apparently incomparably worse than bfq in terms
of responsiveness and latency for time-sensitive applications [2], and
in terms of throughput reached while controlling I/O [3].  And, in all
other tests ran so far, by any entity or group I'm aware of, bfq
results basically on par with or better than mq-deadline.

So, I do understand your need for conservativeness, but, after so much
evidence on single-queue devices, and so many years! :), what's the
point in keeping Linux worse for virtually everybody, by default?

Thanks,
Paolo
