Hi all,

in order to be able to use Micron Quad SPI memories with the new Atmel QSPI
controller I added a new set_protocol() callback into struct spi_nor.
Indeed, once the quad I/O mode has been enabled on a Micron QSPI flash by
clearing bit 7 in its Enhanced Volatile Configuration Register, this memory
expects all the following commands to use the QSPI 4-4-4 protocol. So the
QSPI controller needs to be notified about this protocol change before
reading the Status register, 0x05 command sent by the
spi_nor_wail_till_ready() function, in micron_quad_enable().

Reading spi-nor.h, I saw an interesting struct spi_nor_xfer_cfg and its
associated callbacks write_xfer() and read_xfer(). However these callbacks
don't seem to be used at all for now. They look to have been designed to
add QSPI support to the generic spi-nor framework. So before extending the
framework with my own callback, I'd like to know whether I should have
tried to used the read_xfer()/write_xfer() callbacks to join an already
existing effort to add QSPI support.
If so, I think either the read/write_reg() prototypes should be updated or
new callbacks should be added for register reads/writes. As explained
above, even for reading the Status register the QSPI 4-4-4 protocol must be
used with Micron memories in quad I/O mode. So the framework has to find a
way to tell the QSPI controller which protocol it should use.

So I'm interested in your comments! :)

Best Regards,

Cyrille

ChangeLog

v1:

This series of patches add support for the new Atmel QSPI controller
embedded inside sama5d2x SoCs.

These patches were first developped for linux-3.18-at91 and tested on a
sama5d27 Xplained ultra board, which embeds a Micron n25q128a13 QSPI NOR
flash memory. Then the series was adapted for mainline.
