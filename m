Alternately, it could be also about order in-which platform drivers are mat=
ched
for newly created OF device.

I think for a newly created OF devices the Linux device driver framework wi=
ll
match the platform drivers in the order in which they are registered by mod=
ule
init functions. Now the order of module init function calls will be based h=
ow
the .initcall section is formed by linker and order in which objects are li=
nked.

IMHO, if multiple platform drivers match given OF device then platform driv=
er
with longest matching compatible string should only be probed. I don't know
how big change this would be for OF framework.

Even I think, it will be good to relax the DT bindings requirement for
BRCM NAND driver.
