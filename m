Ah, you're right. Sorry, I missed that. I got mixed up seeing most of
your uses of 'page_sz' were for a local variable of the same name, not
this field.

I'll leave that up to you. I'm perfectly fine leaving it in, now that I
see its proper use. Just in case things change in the future, I think it
does help to clarify the flow of information a little. Although, I might
recommend a change in naming, since it could get confused with the
actual page size -- which is normally constant -- whereas this field
changes dynamically depending on the command-in-flight.

Perhaps the struct could have 'write_len' (to help represent an action)
and the local variable in vf610_nfc_command() could be 'tfr_len' (to
distinguish how it isn't necessarily identical to 'write_len')? Just
throwing (likely bad) ideas out there.

Regards,
Brian
