There's a ->onfi_default_timing_mode field in struct nand_chip. NAND
chip drivers (in your case nand_toshiba.c) should update this field
appropriately at detection time (in their ->init() hook) so that the
core applies ONFI timing mode X by default.

Hope that helps. Let me know if you have other questions or if my
suggestion does not work.
