It should be!

I kept the pxa3xx_nand driver BBT format.

This is something I mistakenly omitted from the commit message:

There are 5 supported layouts in the driver (the same as withing the
pxa3xx_nand driver):
    1/ Page: 512B, strength 1b/512B (hamming)
    2/ Page: 2kiB, strength 4b/2kiB (hamming)
    3/ page: 2kiB, strength 16b/2kiB (BCH)
    4/ page: 4kiB, strength 16b/2kiB (BCH)
    5/ page: 4kiB, strength 32b/2kiB (BCH)

Layout 2 has been tested with CM_X300 compulab module (PXA SoC) with
and without DMA.
Layout 4 has been tested with an Armada 385 db, an Armada 7040 DB and
an Armada 8040 DB.
Layout 5 has been tested with an Armada 398 db.

Layout 1 has been tested with the Armada 385 db with some hacks.
Layout 3 has been tested with the Armada 385 db with some other hacks,
that is why I am concerned about the other thread on the MTD mailing
list "wait timeout when scanning for BB" where a 2kiB page with
16b/2048B strength is in use.
