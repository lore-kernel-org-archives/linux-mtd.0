Did you mean vmalloc()'s?

I am also interested in the potential for the S-G approach. I'll see
what kind of work it takes to implement soon, hopefully.

As a side note, my hardware can, in fact, perform scatter-gather DMA.
If we were to support both S-G hardware like mine in addition to
standard, page-at-time access (nand_chip->write_page, for example),
could we introduce a DMA interface to nand_chip? Then this interface
would just be set to NULL for those that can't handle it.
