Nah, this was dropped around kernel 4.7 from most drivers in favour of
using the default partition probes (ie. cmdline and dt) afaik.

I was planning this somehow, but lack the resources to seriously move
forward. I've mostly been focussing on cleaning up Ma Haiju's code and
improving support for the SATA driver (ie. adding support for both
ports) and re-factoring the stmmac-based Ethernet driver to match the
current kernel driver's style.
However, I'm still using platform-specific includes (hardware.h) and
thus look forward to rebase SATA and Ethernet support on top of your
tree, as that would unluck ox820 support in multi-v6 instead of having
a platform-specific kernel.

Currently there are problems with the NAND driver failing to detect the
chip on non-PCIe platform like the PogoPlug V3 (non-Pro), MitraStar
STG-212 and probably other non-PCIe boards which I didn't check yet.
This magically happened when switching from kernel 4.1 to 4.4, I'm
bisecting this since, but the problem seems to be hidden somewhere
between the lines (ie. probe-order-related or such)...
Did you test your NAND driver on any non-PCIe boards and did it work?


For a more or less complete history of the changes I made since
branching of Ma Haijun's tree, see

https://git.lede-project.org/?p=lede/dangole/staging.git;a=history;f=target/linux/oxnas;hb=refs/heads/oxnas-nand

and for the very early history, prior to the merge into the official
OpenWrt tree, see

http://gitorious.org/openwrt-oxnas/openwrt-oxnas.git


Cheers
