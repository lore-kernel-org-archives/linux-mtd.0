Thanks for sharing that. That's actually a quite interesting beast, and
it's way more evolved than I first thought.

I might be wrong, but it seems that ->cmd_ctrl() can be supported using
the custom NAND op approach (custom uCode in SRAM).

This doesn't prevent you from optimizing things for operations where
performances really matter (read/write with ECC), by using advanced
sequencing (reusing the supported cmdset, or even implementing your
own). I'm actually impressed by the degree of liberty this controller
gives: while some sequences are provided you can create you own ones
and still benefit from the controller optimizations.

Didn't look at the code yet, but I'm pretty confident we'll be able to
make the driver fit in the existing model, and that moving to the new
model (where I plan to give more freedom to the controller), will make
it even more interesting.

I'll try to come with a proposal for you to test/review after reviewing
the code.

True.

Let's see if we can do something smarter.
Note that my proposal was to bypass ->cmd_ctrl() usage for path that
are requiring high-perfs (ecc->read/write_page()), and only rely on
if for the other operations, where performances are not important, but
re-usability of existing code is (I'm thinking of NAND detection here).
