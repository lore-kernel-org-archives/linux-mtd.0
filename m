Note that there are two conflicting conventions for what inputs ChaCha takes.
The original paper by Daniel Bernstein
(https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf) says that the block counter is
64-bit and the nonce is 64-bit, thereby expanding the key into 2^64 randomly
accessible streams, each containing 2^64 randomly accessible 64-byte blocks.

The RFC 7539 convention is equivalent to seeking to a large offset (determined
by the first 32 bits of the 96-bit nonce) in the keystream defined by the djb
convention, but only if the 32-bit portion of the block counter never overflows.

Maybe it is only RFC 7539 that matters because that is what is being
standardized by the IETF; I don't know.  But it confused me.

Anyway, I actually thought it was intentional that the ChaCha implementations in
the Linux kernel allowed specifying the block counter, and therefore allowed
seeking to any point in the keystream, exposing the full functionality of the
cipher.  It's true that it's easily misused though, so there may nevertheless be
value in providing a nonce-only variant.
