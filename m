All of it. I don't see a point in having it, when all that it does can
be achieved with standard functions already.

You would probably end up with some more functions that are
implemented for the different variants. They could be prefixed with
the SoC name and selected in the probe() function depending on the
platform id. I don't see why this should get messy.

If the imx508 driver is so much different from the other variants,
that merging it gets too messy, it's probably better to not merge it
with the other variants anyway.
