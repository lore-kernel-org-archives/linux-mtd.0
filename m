Actually, m25p80.c only needs the strings (i.e., the named aliases --
character data), and for the most part, spi-nor.c only needs the IDs (i.e.,
the identification bytes).

What's more, I don't think that any modern SPI NOR user really needs to
be specifying exactly which SPI device it is via a specific string. Our
driver code pretty much always re-detects the device by reading its
device ID. All the SPI NOR code needs to know is how to read its ID.

A little bit of a shot in the dark, as I haven't fleshed this one out:

Would it work to just copy the SPI ID strings into m25p80.c, keep the
full table in spi-nor.c, stop adding SPI ID string (and DT) bindings to
the m25p80 table (force platforms to use "m25p80"-compatible probing, or
maybe something generic like "spi-nor-rdid", "spi-nor-sfdp", etc.) and
eventually kill the strings from spi-nor.c entirely? I really don't want
to propagate string-binding much further into the SPI NOR library, since
everything should be auto-detectable--partly just by an ID table as we
have now, but eventually we can use CFI or SFDP parameters provided by
relatively new SPI NOR chips.

I'm not sure if this is great for the short-term problem of fixing
module-autoloading. Perhaps we should do a short-term hack to duplicate
the SPI ID strings to m25p80.c by including them in a header (and
backport for 3.16.y stable?), but I'd like to disentangle this.
