I think I am missing something here: u-boot reports that the BBT are
located here:

  >>  Bad block table found at page 65472, version 0x01
  >>  Bad block table found at page 65408, version 0x01

which seems to indicate that they are each 64 pages (i.e. 128KB)
long. AFAICT, the log output seems to indicate that blocks are
128KB in size:

  >>   Bad block at 0x06700000
  >>   Bad block at 0x06720000
  >>   Bad block at 0x06740000
  >>   Bad block at 0x06760000

  >>   Bad block at 0x067a0000
  >>   Bad block at 0x067c0000
  >>   Bad block at 0x067e0000

which is also what mtdinfo reports:

  root@mood:~# mtdinfo /dev/mtd4
  mtd4
  Name:                           jffs2
  Type:                           nand
  Eraseblock size:                131072 bytes, 128.0 KiB
  Amount of eraseblocks:          832 (109051904 bytes, 104.0 MiB)
  Minimum input/output unit size: 2048 bytes
  Sub-page size:                  2048 bytes
  OOB size:                       64 bytes
  Character device major/minor:   90:8
  Bad blocks are allowed:         true
  Device is writable:             true
  
So unless I am missing something, *according* to u-boot there are 2 BBT
and each BBT is 1 block long. 

Additionally - and this is a point I would like to understand - the
reported location of this BBT is not after the 128MB of the chip but
before the end of those 128MB. This also means before the end of the
last partition. So the definition of the partition itsef gives the
impression that all the blocks in the partition are available when in
fact, the last two blocks cannot be used at all (or 8 if you are
right). Put in a different manner, if I nandwrite a 104.0 MiB image to
the last partition (/dev/mtd4), I am guaranteed to try and overwrite the
BBT. 

Do not hesitate to tell me what I am missing here or if it is
expected that the partition definition (start address and length)
*includes* the bbt pages/blocks.

Well, I did the same test again, and I think the answer is 'no':

Well, this time I don't get the "ready timeout" error I had last
time around block 800. I did the test a second time (flash_erase and
then nandwrite) and got the same result, i.e. no error before 824.

As I can not reproduce previous behavior (I am on the exact same
kernel), I guess it's difficult to go any further yet.
