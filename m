AFAICT fsl-quadspi does just that preventing the use of the SPI
controller for non-flash devices.

There is at least one accelerated driver that is passed the opcodes to
program in the controller for read acceleration in spi_flash_read so
reusing that should be viable. If the opcodes can be programmed or
match what is hardcoded in the controller use the acceleration and
fallback to plain spi transfer if there is mismatch between what
m25p80_read requests and what the controller can do.

If this works and you can still use the plain SPI trnsfers the
controller will be much morer useful than fsl-quadspi.
