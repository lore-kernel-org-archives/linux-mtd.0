But there's still a mkfs.ubifs binary, right? I searched fstests mail
archive and found that Dongsheng Yang did set MKFS_UBIFS_PROG in his
patch in 2015. Then I suspect if mkfs.ubifs binary is unavailable, then
_scratch_mkfs would complain mkfs.ubifs not found and fail the test.

If it's not needed or there's no mkfs.ubifs exists, then _scratch_mkfs
needs some updates I guess, and describe this in commit log too, because
it's too different from other block device based local filesystems.

Agreed.

If there's really no standard way to probe for ubifs, a "-ubifs" option
would be the only choice I think, and better to have some comments too.

Thanks,
