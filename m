This looks like the problem which some other controllers(from ti,
freescale) are facing.
I will just summarise the problem with the ti qspi flash controller 
which I am
working on. There is a set of registers which need to be filled with flash
specific commands. One way to deal it with to provide a device tree bindings
for all the requirements(which is really cumbersome.).

Similarly, for freescale there is a LUT registers which has such flash 
requirements.

So, surely we need a way out from m25p80 driver to handle such cases.

drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c


int pass_flash_info () {

    u8 info[6];

      info[0] = DUMMY WR;
      info[1] = RD_OPCODE;
      info[2] - DUMMY BITS;
      ......
     .......
    spi_write(flash, info, 6)
}
Then, somehow parse this information to set up the required info.
  This is just a rough idea, and can be implemented in a better way.
