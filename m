I second this -- introduction of a CONFIG_DEFAULT_MQ_IOSCHED.
Having a default I/O scheduler kernel config option for MQ allows to
build a kernel suitable for specific use w/o userspace
dependencies.
(But it still allows to reconfigure things via userspace.)

Good question. I am not yet sure about this.
I'd start with using the default for single queue devices.
