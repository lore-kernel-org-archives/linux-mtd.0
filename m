Hi,

could you please add the mt7623 compat string to the documentation
aswell while at it ? mt7623/mt2701 are essentially the same and it'll
safe us time and effort and not cause merge order conflicts. otherwise i
would need to wait till the mt2701 patch is merged before i can send the
mt7623 one

Thanks !
	John
