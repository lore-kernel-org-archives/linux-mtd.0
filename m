That would make sense.  But the include location would be strange.

The <asm/mach/flash.h> file is used by various arch/arm/mach-* files and in=
 a
couple of drivers/mtd/maps/*.c files.

The <linux/spi/flash.h> file is also used by various arch/arm/mach-* files =
as
well as some arch/blackfin and arch/mips files.  It's also used by some
drivers in drivers/mtd/devices and by drivers/spi/spi_butterfly.c.

Because of the multi architecture use, the unifying should be done in the
include/linux/spi/flash.h file.  But this include in the various platform
init's might seem "strange" since the flash is not "spi".

I guess the other option would be to rename the spi version to something li=
ke:

struct spi_flash_data {
	...
};

Any comments from the mtd people?
