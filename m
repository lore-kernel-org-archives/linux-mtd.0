Will be addressed soon ;-).

Actually the nand_{get,set}_controller_data() helpers are not about
assigning NAND controller private data (as you pointed those can
already be retrieved thanks to the ->controller field using the
container_of() trick), but per-chip private data instantiated by the
NAND controller and attached to a specific chip. For example, some
controllers pre-compute some register values or a clk rate to set when
a specific chip is selected. This is what per-chip controller data is
meant for.

Now, the reason I explicitly specified the data usage instead of using
a generic name like nand_{get,set}_data() is because I plan to define
other helpers to allow NAND manufacturer code to manipulate its own
private data. This is required if we want to support read-retry on some
chips who are requiring a read OTP area step to retrieve some register
values which will later be used to change from one read-retry mode to
another.
The plan was to define the nand_{set,get}_manufacturer_data() helpers,
and create or reuse an existing priv field (mtd->priv?) to store this
private data.

Also note that the spi framework provides the same kind of helpers [1].

This being said, I'm perfectly fine changing the function names, but
I'd like to replace it by something explicitly telling the user that
this field should only be set by NAND controller drivers.
