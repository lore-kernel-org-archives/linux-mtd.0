That's nonsense. You cannot copy a byte inside a page that is not
programmable (that's what Bad Blocks are).
You only need to check the byte in a well known location once and
create a BBT in flash that carries the bad block information. After
that you need not check for any bad block markers any more, but simply
use the BBT.
Since you need to program the bootloader with some external tool
anyway, that tool is the right instance to do the bad block scan and
create the BBT.
That's what we at Ka-Ro are doing since the early days of the i.MX27
for all our i.MX boards.

You are mixing up two different things. The Bad block markers in
certain locations in the OOB area mark 'Factory bad blocks'
i.e. blocks that are already bad when you apply power to the flash for
the first time. The manufacturer guarantees that initial bad blocks
can be detected by checking those locations for a non-FF value.
There is no guarantee that you may be able to write any specific value
to a certain byte in a block that has turned bad due to wearout or
whatever at any later time. Thus bad blocks that appear due to wearout
should be kept track of in the BBT, not by writing any 'bad block
markers' to the defective blocks themselves.

It's not exactly a bug (which would be possible to get fixed), but an
inherent feature of the controller which handles NAND flash with a
page size larger than 512 byte like it has n pages of 512 byte.
