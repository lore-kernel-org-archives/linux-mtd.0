Unfortunately, it seems I can't make this driver work with my BCM4708
based router. This is a SoC with 6.01 controller.

Sometimes I get this:
[    0.478443] brcmstb_nand 18028000.nand: timeout waiting for command 255 (9)

(Btw. I guess you could use 0x%x instead of %d for printing commands).

It seems that brcmnand_ctlrdy_irq never fires on my device. Just like
controller was never generating any IRQ.


I started comparing your driver with OpenWrt's bcm_nand.c (which
should be very similar to Broadcom's SDK NAND driver for ARM). Below
are few things I've noticed.

1) In bcm_nand.c IRQ handler also doesn't seem to be fired (or very rarely).

2) In brcmnand_waitfunc you seem to be always waiting for an
interrupt. This is different from OpenWrt's driver and Broadcom's
reference code. In bcm_nand.c in bcmnand_wait_cmd we first check
BIT(31) of IRQ STATUS (0x6c / 0x14 / BRCMNAND_INTFC_STATUS). If it's
set, we assume command was already completed.

3) In bcm_nand.c in IRQ waiting function bcmnand_wait_interrupt we
ack/enable/disable NANDC_IRQ_CONTROLLER_RDY (nand_ctlrdy) IRQ. I don't
see that in your code, not sure if it's important.

4) It seems bcm_nand.c also uses some extra register 0x500 and its bit
0x1 (we call it NANDC_IDM_IO_CTRL_RDY). It this bit it set, we don't
ever care about NANDC_IRQ_CONTROLLER_RDY (nand_ctlrdy) IRQ.
