Actually, this is what the patch does: spi_nor_read_dummy_cycles() was reused
and enhanced few lines below where you've pointed out the 
"switch (nor->flash_read)" block should be move after the else block.

I think when I wrote the code I've chosen to move the definition of this
function instead of adding forward declarations of functions such as read_cr()
or write_sr_cr(), which are now called by micron_set_dummy_cycles().

Good idea!
I also add a trace for the default case of "switch (JEDEC_MFR(info))":

dev_warn(dev, "can't set the number of dummy cycles\n");

So the user is notified that the driver could not use the value of
"m25p,num-dummy-cycles" from the DT before falling back to the legacy
code.

thanks for the review!
