Since I used Code Sourcery tools-chain (2010q1-202) to compile the code 
and I didn't get any warning.

So I am not sure what's caused above warnings. From the warning message, 
I don't know the reason exactly.

I just checked the PMECC read/write functions definition in my patch

+static int atmel_nand_pmecc_read_page(struct mtd_info *mtd,
+		struct nand_chip *chip, uint8_t *buf, int32_t page)

+static void atmel_nand_pmecc_write_page(struct mtd_info *mtd,
+		struct nand_chip *chip, const uint8_t *buf)


compare with the original HW read function (no write function)

static int atmel_nand_read_page(struct mtd_info *mtd,
		struct nand_chip *chip, uint8_t *buf, int page)


The only difference is int32_t, and I don't think the warning is caused 
by this int32_t.

Could you have any ideas to fix such warning? That should be very 
helpful for me.

I'll fix it.

For these two warnings, I would like to keep it for more readable. but 
if you would like to fix the warning, then I can fix them too by split 
into two lines.
