Particularly, mach-pxa MTD_XIP looks like it's broken, at least since
here:

  5d284e353eb1 ARM: pxa: avoid accessing interrupt registers directly

  CC      drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0002.o
drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0002.c: In function ‘xip_udelay’:

Looks like arch/arm/mach-pxa/include/mach/mtd-xip.h can't find ICIP or ICMR...
