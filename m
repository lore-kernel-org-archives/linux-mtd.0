I like the kernel command line a lot :)
And *being the end-user* I like to be the one defining and modifying it
according to my current needs. For that reason I do *not* like firmware
bootloaders to prepend/append or even overwrite the cmdline for things
like selecting the rootfs, because usually that restricts the use of
the relevant parameters by device owners.
Imagine: The device runs a bootloader which already sets rootfs= or
overwrites the cmdline of the stock firmware. How will an end-user
who cannot change the bootloader use an alternative OS which uses e.g.
a USB pendrive as it's rootfs? This is why we end up with things like
renaming kernel cmdline parameters in alternative firmware projects,
e.g. rootfs2=...., so end-users can re-gain access to cmdline
parameters augmented by the bootloader.
For that reason I believe that using the cmdline to pass
*non-user-defined* details from the bootloader to the kernel is just
not such a nice thing to do.

The same kernel gets used on many devices having different $vendor
mtd-partition layouts. A way other than the kernel cmdline allows
to specify the default behaviour without restricting the user to
manually use those cmdline options.

Same arguments as above. In addition, we do not want to hard-code the
filesystem type used for the rootfs volume, as it can either be UBIFS
or a read-only filesystem needing a ubiblock device. Thus we would
need the bootloader to know which filesystem *type* is being used and
then decide wether to pass 'rootfs=ubiX:Y' or
'ubiblock=... rootfs=/dev/ubiblock0'.

But we do have MTD and MTD partitions in DT. To me it'd feel more
consistent if MTD devices, partitioning and which MTD partition(s) to
use as UBI would be defined in the same place.
