Not sure it clarifies the per-chip aspect ;), and driver is, IMHO, too
generic: I also consider manufacturer specific code as drivers (but in
this case they are chip drivers, not controller drivers).

How about nand_{get,set}_ctrldrvdata()?

Yes, I don't like the idea of using mtd->priv to store that, but it's
shame to have this unused field and create another one :p.

Well, "driver data" in this case is the data used by the i2c device
driver (the driver communicating with the device on the i2c bus), while
the "controller state" is the per-device controller specific data.
If we do the analogy with the NAND framework, I'd consider the
"SPI controller state" as what I call here the "NAND controller per-chip
data", and the "SPI driver data" as the "manufacturer data".

I know the names are not necessarily better in the SPI framework, but I
think we should find names that describe as much as possible which
data is used by which part of the code.

If you're OK with that I'd like to keep a name containing the
'controller' or 'ctrl' word in it:
1/ nand_{get,set}_controller_data() (the names originally proposed)
2/ nand_{get,set}_ctrldrv_data() or nand_{get,set}_ctrldrvdata()

What do you prefer?

Best Regards,

Boris
