Hi Brian,  The current station is as follows.

1: put 0x9F to MTK_NOR_PRGDATA5_REG, and five 0x0 to
MTK_NOR_PRGDATA4_REG ~ MTK_NOR_PRGDATA0_REG, then set (1 + 5) * 8 
to MTK_NOR_CNT_REG, for this way, we can read five IDs.

2: put 0x9F to MTK_NOR_PRGDATA5_REG, and five 0x0 to
MTK_NOR_PRGDATA4_REG ~ MTK_NOR_PRGDATA0_REG, then set (1 + 5 + 1) * 8
to MTK_NOR_CNT_REG, for this way, we can read six IDs.
In this case, nor flash IDs can be read from MTK_NOR_SHREG5_REG to
MTK_NOR_SHREG0_REG . Thanks!
