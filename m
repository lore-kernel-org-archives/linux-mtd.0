Hm, the real goal of this patch was to avoid accessing the
NFC_REG_USER_DATA_BASE register using byte accessors (writeb()).
The first version of this series was directly copying data from the
buffer into a temporary u32 variable, thus forcing the data to be stored
in little endian (tell me if I'm wrong), and then changing endianness
using le32_to_cpu().
Brian suggested to use __raw_writel() (as you seem to suggest too), but
I was worried about the missing mem barrier in this function.
That's why I made my own macro doing the little endian to CPU conversion
manually, but still using the standard writel() accessor (which will
do the conversion in reverse order).
Maybe I should use __raw_writel() and add an explicit memory barrier.

AFAIU the peripheral is always in little endian, and only the CPU can
be switched to big endian, right?
Are you saying that memcpy_toio() uses writel? Because according to
this implementation [2] it uses writeb, which should be safe (accessing
the internal SRAM using byte accessors is authorized).

AFAICT, buffer passed to ->write_bu() are not necessarily aligned on
32bits, so using writel here might require copying data in temporary
buffers :-/.

Don't hesitate to point where I'm wrong ;-).
