I realized you are packing these tight because you're using them as
combinable (bitwise OR) flags (hence the name FLASH_FLAG_*, duh!). So
while my scheme is nicer for representing a single opcode w.r.t.
controller requirements, it is not able to represent the exact opcodes
supported by a particular flash. Hence, this is not the right place for
it.

But I don't want to imitate your flags in any generic framework; we need
a method (that doesn't involve too many extra tables like in your
driver; or that supports these tables generically, to share with other
drivers) to map the "supported opcodes" flags to useful properties that
the controller/driver can examine.

Is it possible, for instance, to describe a range of opcodes supported
using patterns? Like "this flash supports opcodes for 1-4 data pins and
1-2 address pins"? Or am I being too idealistic, and most flash really
support a totally arbitrary combination of opcodes?
