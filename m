Unfortunately not, it's ST company confidential.

The OPCODE isn't the issue here.

I _fully_ understand your implementation, but it just won't work for
our controller. Or it would, but it would mean writing _more_ code to
bend it into your framework, not less. Let me try to explain in
another way by implementing what you're suggesting. For your JEDEC
example above, we would have to implement [1] which to my mind
completely defeats the purpose.

Most controllers just take an OPCODE and pass it on to the controller
and have done with it. The issue that you're attempting to rectify is
that the m25p80 expects every controller to be an SPI controller
registered to the SPI framework, but as we both know that's not always
practical as the SPI framework doesn't allow all configuration
information to be passed back to the controller driver. Our issue is
not the same. We are required to send entire 'message sequences', to
the controller rather than just opcodes. The JEDEC message sequence
can be seen below. Bear in mind that this is also one of the more
simple message sequences. Some of them even vary depending on which
chip is present.
