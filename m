It is optional. If it is disabled we error out on platforms that have
the ELM IP. But if it is enabled, we don't want to fail probe on such platforms.

I understand. We need to update that description. It is no longer the case that
we have to disable ELM engine to work on older platforms.

Right. I will resend this patch with this fixup
and update the Kconfig description as well.
